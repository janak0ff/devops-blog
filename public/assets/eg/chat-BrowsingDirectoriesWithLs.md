Exercise 1 - Browsing Directories
ls

In this exercise, you will learn how to browse the content of directories using the ls command.

ls is a special command that the shell interprets and runs as a program.

1.1. Viewing files in the current working directory
Typing and entering ls will display all files and directories contained within your current working directory:

1
ls

Copied!
Your default current working directory in this lab environment, the /home/project directory, is empty. Thus entering ls into the command line will not return anything yet.

1.2. Viewing files and directories within any directory
If you know the path to a directory, you can view its contents by passing the path name as a command line argument to the ls command as follows:

ls [PATH TO DIRECTORY]

For example:

1
ls /

Copied!
will show the contents of 'slash', your Linux system's root directory.

Recall some of the standard subdirectories of 'slash' that you've learned about previously:

Directory Contains
/bin System commands, also called binaries
/sbin System administration binaries
/usr User programs and data
/home Home directory
/media Removable media device directories
For example, entering the following command:

1
ls /bin

Copied!
will display the contents of the /bin directory.

Notice that one of the files in the /bin directory is called "ls". Indeed, when you enter the ls command, Linux searches for and runs the ls command by executing the binary file /bin/ls.

### ASSISTANT

### Exercise 1 - Browsing Directories with `ls`

In this exercise, you're learning how to navigate and view the contents of directories using the `ls` command in a Linux shell environment.

---

### üìå **Summary of Key Concepts**

#### üîπ What is `ls`?

- `ls` is a **command** used to **list directory contents**.
- It is actually a program located at `/bin/ls`.
- When you type `ls`, the shell runs `/bin/ls` to show files and folders in the current or specified directory.

---

### ‚úÖ **1.1 Viewing Files in the Current Working Directory**

**Command:**

```bash
ls
```

**Explanation:**

- This lists all files and directories in your **current working directory**.
- In this lab environment, your current directory is `/home/project`.
- Since it's empty, running `ls` returns nothing (no output).

---

### ‚úÖ **1.2 Viewing Files in Any Directory**

You can list the contents of any directory by specifying its **path**:

**Command:**

```bash
ls [PATH TO DIRECTORY]
```

#### Example:

```bash
ls /
```

- Lists the contents of the **root directory (`/`)**.

#### Common System Directories:

| Directory | Contents                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/bin`    | Essential user command binaries (like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`) |
| `/sbin`   | System administration binaries                          |
| `/usr`    | User programs and data                                  |
| `/home`   | Home directories for users                              |
| `/media`  | Mount points for removable media                        |

---

### üß™ Try These Commands

To explore the system, try these in your terminal:

```bash
ls /              # List root directory contents
ls /bin           # List commands available in /bin
ls /home          # See what users exist (you may see 'project')
ls /etc           # Configuration files
ls /usr/bin       # More user-level command binaries
```

---

### üí° Tip

- If you want to see **hidden files** (those starting with a dot), use:

  ```bash
  ls -a
  ```

- To get a **detailed list** (including file permissions, size, owner, etc.):
  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```

---

Let me know if you'd like to move on to creating files or navigating directories!

Exercise 2 - Navigating Directories
cd

In this exercise, you will explore directories using the cd command.

Recall the symbols used to navigate to special paths:

Symbol Stands for path to
~ Home directory
/ Root directory
. Current directory
.. Parent directory
2.1. Changing your present working directory to your home directory
To change your current working directory to your default home directory, use the ~ symbol as follows:

1
cd ~

Copied!
Note that your lab environment's default home directory, ~, is /home/theia. After changing directories to ~, you can check this yourself by entering the pwd command, which displays the path to your current working directory.

2.2. Changing your present working directory to its parent directory
To change your current working directory to the parent directory of your present working directory, enter the following command using ..:

1
cd ..

Copied!
For example, if your working directory was /home/theia, then the new working directory will be /home.

2.3. Changing working directory to root directory
To change your current working directory to the root directory, use the following command with the / key:

1
cd /

Copied!
2.4. Changing your present working directory to a child directory
Assuming you are still in your root directory, use the following command to change your present working directory to the /bin directory:

1
cd bin

Copied!
The /bin directory is called a child of the root directory, /, because it's a subdirectory within it.

The cd command understands implicitly that bin is the name of a subdirectory of your current working directory. As a result, it deduces that its path is a combination of the current working directory path (/) and the subdirectory name (bin).

Another method to change directories is to enter the command cd ./bin. In this case, . represents the path to your current working directory.

Give it a try by entering cd ./bin in your command line! What directory did you end up in?

Tip: If cd ./bin doesn't take you to the /bin directory, double-check what directory you are currently in. Remember, . represents the directory you are in. If you're already in /bin, the terminal will attempt to direct you to /bin/bin.

2.5. Changing from your working directory back to your home directory
There are multiple ways to change your current working directory back to your default home directory. One way is to return to your parent directory, .., and type the address of your home directory /home/theia:

1
cd ../home/theia

Copied!
A simpler way to do this would be to use the ~ symbol to quickly and directly navigate to your home directory:

1
cd ~

Copied!
Both methods will change your working directory back to your home directory.

2.6. Changing from your working directory to your project directory
Directories that are contained within the same parent directory are called siblings.

In this environment, we have provided a special empty project directory for your work. This project directory is located at /home/project and is a sibling directory to /home/theia.

Change your current working directory to its sibling directory, your project directory, by entering the following command:

1
cd ../project

### ASSISTANT

### Exercise 2 - Navigating Directories with `cd`

In this exercise, you're learning how to **change directories** using the `cd` (change directory) command in a Linux shell.

---

### üß≠ Key Navigation Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning                              | Example                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `~`    | Your **home directory**              | `cd ~` goes to `/home/theia` |
| `/`    | The **root directory** of the system | `cd /`                       |
| `.`    | The **current directory**            | `cd .` stays where you are   |
| `..`   | The **parent directory**             | `cd ..` moves up one level   |

---

### ‚úÖ **2.1 Changing to Your Home Directory**

```bash
cd ~
```

- This takes you to your **default home directory**, which is typically `/home/theia` in this lab environment.
- To confirm:
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ **2.2 Going to the Parent Directory**

```bash
cd ..
```

- Moves **up one level** in the directory hierarchy.
- Example: If you're in `/home/theia`, this will take you to `/home`.

---

### ‚úÖ **2.3 Changing to the Root Directory**

```bash
cd /
```

- Takes you to the **top-level directory** of the file system, called the **root directory**.

---

### ‚úÖ **2.4 Changing to a Child Directory**

#### Method 1: Relative Path

```bash
cd bin
```

- From `/`, this will go to `/bin`.
- Assumes `bin` is a subdirectory of your current working directory.

#### Method 2: Using `.` (Current Directory)

```bash
cd ./bin
```

- Also changes to `/bin` if you're currently in `/`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Tip: Make sure you're in the correct parent directory before navigating into a child directory. If you're already in `/bin`, typing `cd ./bin` would try to go to `/bin/bin`, which may not exist.

---

### ‚úÖ **2.5 Returning to Your Home Directory**

#### Option 1: Using `~` (Fastest Way)

```bash
cd ~
```

- Directly returns you to `/home/theia`.

#### Option 2: Using Relative Path

```bash
cd ../home/theia
```

- Goes up to `/home`, then into the `theia` folder.

---

### ‚úÖ **2.6 Navigating to the Project Directory**

```bash
cd ../project
```

- This switches you from `/home/theia` to its **sibling directory**: `/home/project`.
- Useful for moving between related folders inside `/home`.

---

### üìå Final Tips

- Use `pwd` (Print Working Directory) often to see where you are:
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```
- Combine paths using slashes:
  ```bash
  cd /home/project/myfolder
  ```
- Tab completion helps! Start typing a directory name and press **Tab** to auto-complete.

---

Ready for the next step? Try creating and viewing files using `touch`, `cat`, and `echo`!

### USER

Exercise 3 - Using tab completion and the command history
In this exercise, you will gain familiarity with tab completion and the command history.

3.1. Scrolling through your command history
At the command prompt, simply hit the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys, ‚Üë and ‚Üì, to scroll through your command history.

Assuming you are still in the same session as you were when you completed the previous exercises in this lab, you should see exactly what commands you have entered so far.

For example, suppose you want to use the cd command to navigate to /bin again. Rather than retyping the command, simply press the Up Arrow key until you see the cd bin displayed at the command prompt and press Enter.

Of course, this command will only work as expected if your current working directory is the correct one. If the command fails, you can keep scrolling through your history until you find the cd command to return to your root directory, (cd /). Enter that command first, then use the Up Arrow key to find and enter the cd bin command from your history.

Your command history is very useful if you are doing repetitive tasks and want to avoid retyping things repeatedly.

3.2. Using tab completion
Tab completion can save you a lot of typing, thinking, and time. Let's take a look at some examples.

Type cd /bi and press the Tab key. As you might expect, the command autocompletes to cd /bin. But what happens if you just type cd /b and press Tab?

In this case, nothing happens. But if you hit Tab a second time, you'll see a list of all the valid candidates for autocompletion, namely bin/ and boot/.

Notice that cd /b reappears in the command prompt. You cannot use tab completion while there are multiple valid candidates for autocompletion. To narrow down your choices, add an i at the end of your line, then press Tab again. This time the prompt will fill with cd /bin, the only valid option remaining.

Tip: Tab completion only works when there is one valid candidate for autocompletion. When there are multiple possible options, the command prompt will prompt you to enter more letters until there is only one possible option.

You can even use tab completion repeatedly to "dig into" a directory tree.

Let's say you have used tab completion to get to the point where ls /home is displayed at the command prompt. You can press Tab twice to get a listing of all the directories under /home. As you did with cd /bin, use tab completion to complete the address of a subdirectory such as ls /home/theia. You can repeat this process as many times as you like until you reach the end of a chosen path.

As an exercise, practice using tab completion repeatedly to build up the command ls /home/theia/dsdriver/bin.

Future labs will cover command options more in-depth. In this lab, you became familiar with the terminal environment and some basic commands.

### ASSISTANT

### Exercise 3 - Using **Tab Completion** and **Command History**

In this exercise, you learned two powerful tools to make working in the terminal **faster**, **easier**, and **less error-prone**:

- üîÅ **Command history**
- ‚ú® **Tab completion**

---

## üîÑ 3.1 Scrolling Through Command History

You can easily **review and reuse** previously entered commands using:

| Key              | Action                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| `‚Üë` (Up Arrow)   | Go back one command    |
| `‚Üì` (Down Arrow) | Go forward one command |

### Example:

If you previously typed:

```bash
cd /
cd bin
ls
```

Then pressing `‚Üë` will bring back `ls`, then `cd bin`, then `cd /`, etc.

### Use Case:

Let's say you want to run `cd bin` again:

- Instead of retyping it, press `‚Üë` until you see `cd bin`
- Press `Enter` to execute it again

> üí° If the command doesn't work because your current directory changed, keep scrolling until you find `cd /`, run that first, then try `cd bin`.

---

## üß† 3.2 Using Tab Completion

**Tab completion** helps you type faster by auto-filling file and directory names.

### How It Works:

#### Step-by-step example:

1. Type:
   ```bash
   cd /bi
   ```
2. Press **`Tab`**
   - It autocompletes to:
     ```bash
     cd /bin
     ```

#### What if there are multiple matches?

Try typing:

```bash
cd /b
```

Then press **`Tab`** once ‚Üí nothing happens  
Press **`Tab`** twice ‚Üí You'll see options like:

```
bin/   boot/
```

Now add an `i`:

```bash
cd /bi
```

Press **`Tab`** again ‚Üí completes to:

```bash
cd /bin
```

### Tip:

- **Double-tab (`Tab + Tab`)** shows all possible completions.
- Only works when there‚Äôs **one match** or you're asking for help with ambiguous paths.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Practice: Digging Into a Path Using Tab Completion

Let‚Äôs build a longer command using tab completion:

Start typing:

```bash
ls /ho
```

Press **Tab** ‚Üí becomes:

```bash
ls /home/
```

Now type:

```bash
ls /home/the
```

Press **Tab** ‚Üí becomes:

```bash
ls /home/theia
```

Keep going:

```bash
ls /home/theia/dsdriver/bi
```

Press **Tab** ‚Üí becomes:

```bash
ls /home/theia/dsdriver/bin
```

This way, you built:

```bash
ls /home/theia/dsdriver/bin
```

...without typing the whole thing!

Exercise 1 - Upgrading and installing packages
In your lab environment, we provide you access to a system admistration utility called "super-user do", or sudo.

Although this sandbox environment will not require a password to run the sudo command, typical Linux production-oriented environments will require a password to run sudo.

You will need to use the sudo command to activate the powerful apt command. You'll use apt to upgrade nano to its latest version. You will also use apt to install Vim.

apt (Advanced Packaging Tool) is a powerful command line tool. You use it to perform system administration operations such as installing software packages, upgrading existing packages, and updating your system's package list index.

1.1 Updating your Linux sytem's package list index
Before installing or upgrading any packages on your Linux system, it's best practice to first update your package list index. Go ahead and enter this command,

1
sudo apt update

Copied!
to update (re-synchronize) your package index files from their sources. This will take a bit of time to run. While you're waiting, if you're interested, go ahead and open another terminal and view the locations apt uses to access those sources in the file /etc/apt/sources.list.

In short, running apt with the update option ensures all of your package dependencies are up-to-date and correctly specified prior to making any changes to your system's packages.

1.2. Upgrading nano
nano is a simple command line editor that enables you to use the terminal window as a text editor.

nano is already installed on your system. Go ahead and upgrade to the latest supported version of nano by entering:

1
sudo apt upgrade nano

Copied!
You may be prompted: Do you want to continue? [Y/n]

Type Y and press Enter to continue. Updating nano will take some time to complete.

The capital Y in Y/n (yes or no) means "yes" is the default - if you press Enter without typing anything, the terminal assumes you are choosing "yes".

Note: If you encounter a colon (:) similar to the one highlighted in the screenshot while upgrading Nano, please press 'q' to exit and continue with the upgrade process.

You'll get to use nano soon, but first, let's take a look at the other main use case for apt, installing packages.

1.3. Installing Vim
Another popular text-editing program is Vim. Vim is a highly configurable text editor built for efficiency. It takes some practice to get good at using Vim, but the time investment is very worthwhile.

Because Vim isn't preinstalled on your Linux system, you'll need to install it yourself. If you haven't already done so in this session, ensure you run the command sudo apt update. Then to install Vim, enter the following command:

1
sudo apt install vim

Copied!
Similar to when you updated nano, you may again be prompted: Do you want to continue? [Y/n]

Type Y and press Enter to continue. Vim will begin installing on your system.

In a few exercises, you will use Vim to edit a text file.

### ASSISTANT

### Exercise 1 - Upgrading and Installing Packages with `apt`

In this exercise, you learned how to use the **`sudo`** command along with **`apt`**, a powerful package management tool in Linux. You used it to:

- Update your system's package list
- Upgrade an existing package (`nano`)
- Install a new package (`vim`)

---

## üîê 1.1 Updating Your System‚Äôs Package List Index

### Command:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### What It Does:

- Fetches the latest list of available packages and their versions from configured repositories.
- Ensures that your system knows about the most recent software updates and dependencies.

> üïí This command may take a few moments to complete.  
> üí° You can view the repository sources at `/etc/apt/sources.list`.

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è 1.2 Upgrading `nano`

### Command:

```bash
sudo apt upgrade nano
```

### What Happens:

- Upgrades the already installed `nano` text editor to the latest version.
- You'll be prompted:
  ```
  Do you want to continue? [Y/n]
  ```
- Press **`Y`** then **Enter** to proceed.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you see a `:` prompt during the process (like in a pager), press **`q`** to quit and continue.

---

## üíæ 1.3 Installing `vim`

### Command:

```bash
sudo apt install vim
```

### Why Vim?

- Vim is a highly configurable, powerful text editor.
- Ideal for editing files directly in the terminal.
- Widely used by developers and system administrators.

### Installation Steps:

1. Run:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install vim
   ```
2. Confirm with:
   ```
   Do you want to continue? [Y/n]
   ```
   Type **`Y`** and press **Enter**

> üß† Note: Always run `sudo apt update` before installing or upgrading packages to ensure you're getting the latest software versions.

You‚Äôre now ready to start editing files using both **Nano** and **Vim**! Would you like to try creating and editing files next?

### USER

Exercise 2 - Creating and editing files with nano
In this exercise, you will use the command line editor nano to create and edit a file.

nano is known for being a simple and easy-to-master text editor. Vim is harder to learn, but it has many expert-level features that nano doesn't offer.

2.1 Navigating to the project directory
We provide you with an empty project directory at /home/project. Ensure you're working in this folder by changing directories using the command:

1
cd /home/project

Copied!
Try auto-completing the path by typing cd /home/pr and pressing the Tab key.

If you enter ls here, you shouldn't see any files or subdirectories listed.

2.2 Creating and editing a text file with nano
To create a new file, enter

1
nano hello_world.txt

Copied!
in the terminal. This will simultaneously create a new file called hello_world.txt and enable you to begin editing it using the nano text editor.

Double-check that your new file was created by opening another terminal window and running the ls command on /home/project. You should see hello_world.txt listed.

In your nano terminal, whatever you type will be added to your text buffer, where text is stored until you save it. Type the following text in your nano terminal:

1
Hello world!

Copied!
This will create the text Hello world! in your text buffer.

To create another line of text, press Enter. In your new line, type

1
This is the second line of my first-ever text file created with nano.

Copied!
to create a second line of text in your text buffer.

Now:

Press CTRL+X to exit nano.

You will be prompted as follows:

1
2
3
Save modified buffer (ANSWERING "No" WILL DESTROY CHANGES) ?  
 Y Yes  
 N No ^C Cancel

Copied!
Press Y to save your new lines of text to your file.

Press Enter to confirm the file name.
At this point, nano should have exited and returned you to the command prompt.

2.3 Verifying your new text file
By entering a familiar command, such as

1
cat hello_world.txt

Copied!
you should be able to inspect and verify that your new file contains the two lines you wrote to it with nano. Cool!

### ASSISTANT

Copied!
to create a new file called hello_world_2.txtand edit it using Vim.

Once your Vim session has started, go ahead and press i to enter Insert mode. This is the mode where you can enter and delete text in the text buffer.

Go ahead and type some text in the buffer, for example:

1
Hello World!

Copied!
Just like in nano, press Enter to start a new line, and then type

1
This is the second line.

Copied!
to create a second line of text in the buffer.

When you're done typing text in the buffer, press the Escape key, Esc, to exit the Insert mode. This brings you to Command mode.

In Vim, it's easy to accidentally end up in a mode you didn't intend to be in. No worries - you can use the Esc key to return to Command mode.

Now that you are back in Command mode, you can save your work by entering the command :w. This writes the contents of the text buffer to your text file.

Finally, you can exit your Vim session by entering :q.

Summary & Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that:

In the 1980s, GNU was developed at MIT. GNU stands for ‚ÄúGNU‚Äôs not Unix‚Äù and was made as a free, open source set of the existing Unix system tools. And in 1991, Linus Torvalds developed a free, open source version of the Unix kernel called Linux.

Linux is widely used today in mobile devices, desktops, supercomputers, data centers, and cloud servers.

Linux distributions (also known as distros) differ by their UIs, shell applications, and how the OS is supported and built.

The design of a distro is catered toward its specific audience and/or use case. Popular Linux distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Debian, Ubuntu, Suse (SLES, SLED, OpenSuse), Fedora, Mint, and Arch.

The Linux system consists of five key layers: the UI, application, OS, kernel, and hardware. The user interface enables users to interact with applications. Applications enable users to perform tasks within the system. The operating system runs on top of the kernel and is vital for system health and stability, and the kernel is the lowest-level software that enables applications to interact with hardware. Hardware includes all the physical or electronic components of your PC.

The Linux filesystem is a tree-like structure consisting of all directories and files on the system.

A Linux shell is an OS-level application that you can use to enter commands. You use a terminal to send commands to the shell, and you can use the `cd` command to navigate around your Linux filesystem.

You can use a variety of command-line or GUI-based text editors such as GNU nano, vim, vi, and gedit.

.deb and .rpm are distinct file types used by package mangers in Linux operating systems.

You can use GUI-based and command-line package managers to update and install software on Linux systems.

Getting Help for Linux Commands
There is huge value in spending time exploring and experimenting with commands, but there are many things you can't figure out just by experimenting. You need to see what's out there, see what's possible, and learn where to look to get answers. Let's take a look at some great ways to get the information you need to help you make progress.

In this reading, you may see links to external sources. You can open them by right-clicking and pressing "Open in new tab."

1. Use the built-in man command
   The man command, which stands for "manual", provides the standard way to access help for Unix-like commands from the command prompt. It has been in development since 1971.

You can get a listing of all the commands on your system that have a manual page by entering:

1
man -k .

Copied!
The resulting list includes a brief description of what each command does.

To see the man page for a command, simply enter:

1
man command_name

Copied!
All man pages are divided into several sections, including:

NAME
The name of the command or feature and a brief description of what it does.

SYNOPSIS
A summary of the command syntax, including any options and arguments that can be used.

DESCRIPTION
A more detailed description of the command, including its function and behavior.

OPTIONS
All the available options and arguments that can be used with the command.

EXAMPLES
Some examples of how to use the command.

SEE ALSO
Related commands and documentation that may be helpful.

You may also see other sections, including: EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ENVIRONMENT, BUGS, FILES, AUTHOR, REPORTING BUGS, HISTORY, and COPYRIGHT.

2. Install and use the tldr command
   Similar to man pages, TLDR Pages is a free and open-source collaborative documentation effort. The goal is to create documentation that is more accessible than the traditional man pages, which tend to be quite verbose.

TLDR Pages, short for "Too Long; Didn't Read" and also known simply as tldr, provide examples for common use cases of various commands. The format of TLDR pages is similar to that of a cheatsheet.

You can install a command-line tool to access TLDR Pages from your terminal. Install it using the following command:

1
npm install -g tldr

Copied!
Once you've installed the tool, you can use the tldr command to easily access the TLDR page of a command.

1
tldr command_name

Copied!
The tool will display a short, easy-to-understand summary of the command along with some examples of how to use it.

3. Search Stack Overflow
   Stack Overflow is a popular community-driven question and answer platform for programmers, developers, and system administrators. It has a vast repository of questions and answers related to various programming languages, tools, and operating systems, including Linux.

To search for information about commands on Stack Overflow, you can use the search bar on the homepage and enter the name of the command you're looking for, along with any specific keywords or parameters. You can also refine your search by adding relevant tags, such as "linux" or "command-line".

Once you've entered your search query, Stack Overflow will display a list of relevant questions and answers that match your query. You can browse through the results to find the information you need, and even post your own question if you can't find an answer to your specific query.

When searching for information about commands on Stack Overflow, it's important to check the date of the answers to ensure that the information is still current and relevant. You should also read through the comments and discussion threads to get a better understanding of the context and any potential issues or limitations related to the command you're researching.

Newest questions on Stack Overflow tagged "Linux": https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/linux

4. Search Stack Exchange
   Stack Exchange is a network of question and answer communities, similar to Stack Overflow, but covering a broader range of topics beyond just programming. There are several Stack Exchange communities that specialize in topics related to Linux and open source software, such as Unix & Linux, Ask Ubuntu, and Server Fault.

Visit the relevant community to search for information on Stack Exchange. Like Stack Overflow, you can use the search bar to enter the name of the command you're looking for, along with any keywords or parameters.

Unix and Linux community on Stack Exchange: https://unix.stackexchange.com/

5. Just google it!
   Google is a powerful tool that can provide you the answer to almost any question. Learn how to enter the right queries and filter your results, such as by including "Wikipedia", "Stack Overflow", or "Linux" as part of your search. However, use at your own risk. Never blindly trust what you find on the web - there's a lot of noise out there!

6. Use the cheat sheets from this course
   Throughout this course, you will encounter "cheat sheets" that condense the information you've learned into easy-to-reference guides. They are great for reviewing the material you've learned and can also help you out with your graded assignments.

7. Refer to Wikipedia's list of Unix commands:
   Finally, Wikipedia maintains a list of commands that can be found on Unix operating systems, along with a short description. You can check the page to quickly reference a Unix command: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unix_commands

Summary
This reading has provided an overview of how to find more information about Linux commands. As you continue to use commands in this course and beyond, you'll likely find yourself using the same command patterns over and over. Each time you use a command, you'll get a little more comfortable and familiar with it. Your fingers will develop muscle memory until using commands becomes second nature!

Let me know if you'd like a printable version of this guide or a custom cheat sheet for specific commands! üêßüìò

### USER

Exercise 1 - Informational Commands
In this exercise, you will familiarize yourself with useful commands for providing system and user information.

1.1. Display the name of the current user
whoami

Enter the whoami command to return your current username.

1
whoami

Copied!
It will display the user name as theia because you are logged into this lab as theia.

You can get a list of currently logged in users using the command who, but this command doesn't work in the Theia environment yet.

1.2. Get basic information about the operating system
uname

By default the command prints the kernel name. The u in uname refers to "unix-like 0S".

1
uname

Copied!
If you enter the command uname, you will see Linux printed in the output.

Using the -a option prints all the system information.

1
uname -a

Copied!
You will see system information listed in the following order:

Kernel name
Network node hostname
Kernel release date
Kernel version
Machine hardware name
Hardware platform
Operating system
1.3. Obtain the user and group identity information
id

This command displays the user id and group id information of the current user.

1
id

Copied!
It will display the uid (user id) and gid (group id) for the user theia.

1.4 Get available disk space
df

The df command is used to display available disk space.

1
df

Copied!
This command will display available disk space in 512-byte blocks. To get available disk space in a "human-readable" format, enter:

1
df -h

Copied!
This will return the available disk space in units like gigabytes and terabytes.

1.5. View currently running processes
ps

The ps command lists each process that is currently running and its PID (process id).

1
ps

Copied!
However, the output only contains the processes that are owned by you.

By using the -e option, you can display all of the processes running on the system. The includes processes owned by other users.

1
ps -e

Copied!
1.6. Get information on the running processes and system resources
top

The top or "table of processes" command provides a dynamic, real-time view of your system.

1
top

Copied!
The top command displays a table of detailed information related to the processes or threads which are currently running and managed by the kernel. Additionally, it also provides information related to CPU and memory usage per process.

When you start top, you'll be presented with the following elements on the main top screen:

Summary area - shows information like system uptime, number of users, load average, and overall memory usage
Column header - attribute names
Task area - displays the data for each process, or PID
The output keeps refreshing until you press q or Ctrl + c.

If you want to exit automatically after a specified number of repetitions, use the -n option as follows:

1
top -n 10

Copied!
You can press the following keys with Shift while top is running to sort the table:

Key Sorts by
m Memory Usage
p CPU Usage
n Process ID (PID)
t Running Time
For example, you can find out which process is consuming the most memory by entering Shift + m.

1.7. Display Messages
echo

The echo command displays the given text on the screen. For example, entering:

1
echo "Welcome to the linux lab"

Copied!
prints:

1
Welcome to the linux lab.

Copied!
These special characters help you better format your output:

Special Character Effect
\n Start a new line
\t Insert a tab
Use the -e option of the echo command when working with special characters. For example:

1
echo -e "This will be printed \nin two lines"

Copied!
will print:

1
2
This will be printed
in two lines

Copied!
1.8. Display date and time
date

The date command displays the current date and time.

1
date

Copied!
It has several options which allow you to display the current date and time in different formats.

For example, the following command displays the current date in mm/dd/yy format:

1
date "+%D"

Copied!
Here are some popular format specifiers that you can try out:

Specifier Explanation
%d Displays the day of the month (01 to 31)
%h Displays the abbreviated month name (Jan to Dec)
%m Displays the month of year (01 to 12)
%Y Displays the four-digit year
%T Displays the time in 24 hour format as HH:MM:SS
%H Displays the hour
1.9. View the Reference Manual For a Command
man

The man command displays the user manual for any command that you provide as its argument.

For example, to see the manual page for the ls command, enter:

1
man ls

Copied!
Scroll through the command's manual to find any info you may need. When you're done, press q to quit.

### üí° Hint:

The `ps` command lists running processes. Use an option to show **all** processes.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
ps -e
```

This shows every process currently running on the system, not just those owned by the current user.

---

## üîπ **3. Get the table of processes and sort by memory usage**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `top` command and a keyboard shortcut to sort by memory.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
top
```

Once inside `top`, press:

```
Shift + M
```

This sorts the list by **memory usage**, allowing you to quickly identify which processes are using the most RAM.

> To exit `top`, press `q`.

---

## üîπ **4. Display the current time**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `date` command with a format specifier to show only the time.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
date "+%T"
```

Output example:

```
14:25:36
```

Other useful formats:

- `date "+%H:%M"` ‚Üí `14:25`
- `date "+%r"` ‚Üí `02:25:36 PM`

---

## üîπ **5. Using one command, display the messages "Hello!" and "Goodbye!" separated by a new line**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `echo` command with the `-e` option to interpret escape sequences like `\n`.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
echo -e "Hello!\nGoodbye!"
```

Output:

```
Hello!
Goodbye!
```

> The `-e` flag enables interpretation of backslash escapes like `\n` (new line) and `\t` (tab).

---

## üéØ Bonus Tips

- Combine `echo` with redirection to write text into files:
  ```bash
  echo "Hello World" > hello.txt
  ```
- Use `watch` to monitor changing output:
  ```bash
  watch "ps -e | head -n 10"
  ```

You're doing great! These exercises help build your confidence in navigating and managing a Linux system from the terminal.

Would you like more practice with file operations, permissions, or scripting? Let me know ‚Äî I can provide custom labs tailored to your goals! üêßüíª‚ú®

### USER

Exercise 1 - Navigating Files and Directories
In these exercises, you will practice using commands for navigating and managing files and directories.

1.1. Get the location of the present working directory
pwd

When working in a Linux terminal, you will always be working from a directory. By default, you will start in your home directory. To get the absolute path of your present working directory, enter the following:

1
pwd

Copied!
This will print the name of the directory you are currently working in.

1.2. List the files and directories in a directory
ls

To list the files and directories in the current directory, enter the following:

1
ls

Copied!
If your directory happens to be empty, ls will not return anything.

The following command will list the many binary and executable files which are present in your /bin (binaries) directory.

1
ls /bin

Copied!
The /bin directory happens to be where Linux commmands such as ls and pwd are stored. For example, you can see that ls is present by entering the following:

1
ls /bin/ls

Copied!
To list all files starting with b in the /bin directory, try entering the following:

1
ls /bin/b\*

Copied!
Tip: The asterisk \* is a special character called a wildcard. It is used to represent any string of characters.

To list all files ending in r in the /bin directory, enter the following:

1
ls /bin/\*r

Copied!
To print a longer list of files with additional information, such as the last-modified date, enter the following:

1
ls -l

Copied!
Here are some common options that you can try with the ls command:

Option Description
-a list all files, including hidden files
-d list directories only, do not include files
-h with -l and -s, print sizes like 1K, 234M, 2G
-l include attributes like permissions, owner, size, and last-modified date
-S sort by file size, largest first
-t sort by last-modified date, newest first
-r reverse the sort order
To get a long list of all files in /etc, including any hidden files, enter the following:

1
ls -la /etc

Copied!
Here we combined the options -l and -a by using the shorter notation, -la.

### ASSISTANT

### üìÅ Exercise 1 - Navigating Files and Directories

In this exercise, you practiced essential Linux commands for **navigating the filesystem**, **listing directory contents**, and understanding **file patterns**.

---

## üìç 1.1 Get the Location of the Present Working Directory

### Command:

```bash
pwd
```

### What It Does:

- Stands for **"Print Working Directory"**
- Shows the **full path** to the directory where you are currently located

Example output:

```
/home/theia
```

---

## üìã 1.2 List Files and Directories in a Directory

### Basic Usage:

```bash
ls
```

- Lists all **non-hidden files and directories** in the current location
- If the directory is empty, it returns nothing

### View Contents of `/bin` (Binary Directory):

```bash
ls /bin
```

- Displays system-level commands like `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, etc.
- You can also look at specific files:
  ```bash
  ls /bin/ls
  ```

### Use Wildcards to Match Patterns:

#### üîç All files starting with `b`:

```bash
ls /bin/b*
```

#### üîç All files ending with `r`:

```bash
ls /bin/*r
```

> üí° The `*` wildcard matches any number of characters

---

## üìÑ Long Listing Format

### See detailed file information:

```bash
ls -l
```

Includes:

- File type and permissions
- Number of links
- Owner
- Group
- Size in bytes
- Last modification date/time
- File or directory name

### Common `ls` Options:

| Option | Description                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `-a`   | Show hidden files (those starting with `.`) |
| `-d`   | Show directories only                       |
| `-h`   | Human-readable sizes (e.g., KB, MB)         |
| `-l`   | Long listing format                         |
| `-S`   | Sort by file size (largest first)           |
| `-t`   | Sort by modification time (newest first)    |
| `-r`   | Reverse sort order                          |

### Example: List all files (including hidden ones) in long format:

```bash
ls -la
```

### Example: List all files in `/etc` with details:

```bash
ls -la /etc
```

This helps you explore system-wide configuration files.

| Human-readable sizes        | `ls -lh`                   |

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Combine options:
  ```bash
  ls -lah   # Long list, human-readable, include hidden
  ```
- Use tab completion to avoid typing full paths:
  ```bash
  ls /bi<TAB>
  ```
  Becomes:
  ```bash
  ls /bin/
  ```

Copied!
Next, use the touch command to create an empty file named myfile.txt:

1
touch myfile.txt

Copied!
Now use the ls command to verify the creation of myfile.txt:

1

Copied!
If the file already exists, the touch command updates the access timestamp, or last-modified date of the file. To see this, enter:

1
touch myfile.txt

Copied!
And use the date command to verify the date change:

1
date -r myfile.txt

## ‚úÖ Summary of Commands Covered

| Task                                     | Command                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Create a directory                       | `mkdir directory_name` |
| Change working directory                 | `cd directory_name`    |
| Move up one directory level              | `cd ..`                |
| Go back to home directory                | `cd`                   |
| Create an empty file or update timestamp | `touch filename`       |

---

## üßæ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 2.1 Create a Directory with `mkdir`

```bash
mkdir scripts
```

- Creates a new directory named `scripts` in your current location

Verify it was created:

```bash
ls
```

You should see `scripts` listed.

---

### üîπ 2.2 Change Working Directory with `cd`

Move into the `scripts` directory:

```bash
cd scripts
```

Check your current location:

```bash
pwd
```

Return to your home directory:

```bash
cd
```

Move up one level (to the parent directory):

```bash
cd ..
```

This is useful when navigating through nested directories.

---

### üîπ 2.3 Create an Empty File with `touch`

Go back to your home directory:

```bash
cd
```

Create a new file called `myfile.txt`:

```bash
touch myfile.txt
```

Verify the file exists:

```bash
ls
```

If the file already exists, `touch` updates its **last-modified timestamp**:

```bash
touch myfile.txt
```

To check the updated timestamp:

```bash
date -r myfile.txt
```

This shows the last time the file was accessed or modified.

---

## üìã Tips & Tricks

- You can create multiple directories at once:
  ```bash
  mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
  ```
- Make a nested directory structure easily:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p project/files/data
  ```
  The `-p` option creates parent directories as needed.
- Use tab completion for faster navigation:
  ```bash
  cd scri<TAB>
  ```
  Completes to:
  ```bash
  cd scripts
  ```

---

## üß† Why These Commands Matter

These basic tools are essential for managing your workspace in Linux:

- `mkdir`: Organize your files by creating structured directories
- `cd`: Navigate between folders quickly
- `touch`: Create placeholder files or update timestamps for testing or scripting purposes

Let me know and I‚Äôll walk you through how to manage files like a pro! üêßüìÅ‚ú®

### USER

Exercise 3 - Managing Files and Directories
3.1. Search for and locate files
find

The find command is used to search for files in a directory. You can search for files based on different attributes, such as the file's name, type, owner, size, or timestamp.

The find command conducts a search of the entire directory tree starting from the given directory name.

For example, the following command finds all .txt files in the /etc directory and all of its subdirectories:

1
find /etc -name \'\*.txt\'

Copied!
Note: Along with listing all the .txt files, the terminal may return "Permission denied" errors.
These errors are normal, as you have limited access permissions on the lab machine.

3.2. Remove files
rm

The rm command is used to delete files, ideally with the -i option, which creates a prompt to ask for confirmation before every deletion.

To remove the file myfile.txt, enter the following command and press y to confirm deletion, or n to deny deletion:

1
rm -i myfile.txt

Copied!
Use the ls command to verify removal:

1
ls

Copied!
Tip: When you are only removing one file with the rm command, the -i option is redundant. But if you want to remove multiple files, for example by using a wildcard to find all filenames matching a pattern, it's best practice to confirm or deny each deletion by including the -i option.

Be careful when deleting files or directories! There is normally no way to restore a deleted file once it is deleted, as there is no trash folder. This is why you should always back up, or archive, your important files. You will learn more about archiving files soon.

3.3. Move and rename a file
mv

You can use the mv command to move files from one directory to another and/or rename them.

Before doing so, let's first create a new file called users.txt:

1
touch users.txt

Copied!
You should always use caution when moving a file. If the target file already exists, it will be overwritten, or replaced, by the source file.

Conveniently, however, when the source and target directories are the same, you can use mv to rename a file.

To illustrate this, use mv to rename users.txt to user-info.txt by entering the following command:

1
mv users.txt user-info.txt

Copied!
Because the source and target directories are the same (your present working directory), the mv command will rename the file.

Now use the ls command to verify the name change:

1
ls

Copied!
Now, you can move user-info.txt to the /tmp directory as follows:

1
mv user-info.txt /tmp

Copied!
Use the ls command twice to verify the move:

1
ls

Copied!
1
ls -l /tmp

Copied!
3.4. Copy files
cp

You can use the cp command to copy user-info.txt, which is now in your /tmp directory, to your current working directory:

1
cp /tmp/user-info.txt user-info.txt

Copied!
Use the ls command to verify that the copy was successful:

1
ls

Copied!
At times, you may want to copy the contents of an existing file into a new one.

The following command copies the content of /etc/passwd to a file named users.txt within the current directory:

1
cp /etc/passwd users.txt

Copied!
Again, use the ls command to verify if the copy was successful:

1
ls

### üìÅ Exercise 3 - Managing Files and Directories

In this exercise, you practiced essential Linux commands for **searching**, **removing**, **moving**, **renaming**, and **copying** files and directories ‚Äî key skills for managing your system effectively.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary of Commands Covered

| Task                  | Command       |
| --------------------- | ------------- |
| Search for files      | `find`        |
| Remove (delete) files | `rm`, `rm -i` |
| Move or rename files  | `mv`          |
| Copy files            | `cp`          |

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 3.1 Search for Files Using `find`

```bash
find /etc -name '*.txt'
```

- Searches the `/etc` directory and its subdirectories for all `.txt` files.
- `-name` specifies a filename pattern to match.
- You may see "Permission denied" errors ‚Äî these are normal due to access restrictions in lab environments.

---

### üîπ 3.2 Remove Files with `rm`

```bash
rm -i myfile.txt
```

- The `-i` option prompts for confirmation before deletion:
  ```
  rm: remove regular file 'myfile.txt'? y/n
  ```

After deletion, verify:

```bash
ls
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Deleted files **cannot be recovered easily**. Always double-check what you're deleting.

Use without `-i` only when sure:

```bash
rm myfile.txt
```

Delete multiple files safely using confirmation:

```bash
rm -i *.txt
```

---

### üîπ 3.3 Move or Rename Files with `mv`

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Rename a File:

```bash
mv users.txt user-info.txt
```

This renames `users.txt` to `user-info.txt` in the same directory.

Verify:

```bash
ls
```

#### üì¶ Move a File to Another Directory:

```bash
mv user-info.txt /tmp
```

Moves `user-info.txt` to the `/tmp` directory.

Verify:

```bash
ls
ls -l /tmp
```

> üí° If the target file already exists, it will be overwritten silently ‚Äî always be cautious!

---

### üîπ 3.4 Copy Files with `cp`

#### üìÑ Copy from One Location to Another:

```bash
cp /tmp/user-info.txt user-info.txt
```

This copies the file back to your current working directory.

Verify:

```bash
ls
```

#### üìÇ Copy Content of a System File:

```bash
cp /etc/passwd users.txt
```

This creates a new file `users.txt` containing the contents of `/etc/passwd`.

Check that the copy was successful:

```bash
ls
cat users.txt
```

You can also view the first few lines:

```bash
head users.txt
```

---

## üß∞ Pro Tips

- Use wildcards to move or copy groups of files:
  ```bash
  cp *.txt /backup/
  mv *.log logs/
  ```
- Combine `cp` with `-r` to copy entire directories:
  ```bash
  cp -r myfolder/ backup/
  ```
- Use `rm -r` carefully to delete directories and their contents:
  ```bash
  rm -r myfolder
  ```

---

## üß† Why These Commands Matter

These tools give you full control over your filesystem:

- `find`: Locate files across your system
- `rm`: Clean up unwanted files
- `mv`: Reorganize or rename files
- `cp`: Duplicate or archive content

They form the foundation for automating tasks, writing scripts, and managing data efficiently.

### üìö **Practice Exercises ‚Äì Managing Files and Directories**

Here are the practice exercises with **hints** and **solutions** to help reinforce your understanding of Linux commands for navigating, creating, moving, copying, and deleting files and directories.

---

## üîπ **1. Display the contents of the /home directory**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `ls` command to list directory contents.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
ls /home
```

This shows all user directories inside `/home`.

---

## üîπ **2. Ensure that you are in your home directory**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `cd` command without arguments to return to your home directory.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cd
```

You can verify using:

```bash
pwd
```

It should output something like:

```
/home/theia
```

---

## üîπ **3. Create a new directory called tmp and verify its creation**

### üí° Hint:

Use `mkdir` to create a directory and `ls` to confirm it exists.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
mkdir tmp
ls
```

You should see `tmp` listed in the output.

---

## üîπ **4. Create a new, empty file named display.sh in the tmp directory, and verify its creation**

### üí° Hint:

Navigate into the `tmp` directory and use `touch` to create an empty file.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cd tmp
touch display.sh
ls
```

You should see `display.sh` listed.

---

## üîπ **5. Create a copy of display.sh, called report.sh, within the same directory**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `cp` command to make a copy of a file.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cp display.sh report.sh
ls
```

Now both `display.sh` and `report.sh` should be listed.

---

## üîπ **6. Move your copied file, report.sh, up one level in the directory tree to the parent directory. Verify your changes**

### üí° Hint:

Use `mv` to move the file and `cd ..` or `ls -l ../` to check.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
mv report.sh ..
ls ..
```

Or:

```bash
cd ..
ls
```

You should now see `report.sh` in the parent directory.

---

## üîπ **7. Delete the file display.sh**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `rm` command to delete a file. Consider using `-i` for confirmation (optional).

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
rm display.sh
```

To verify:

```bash
ls
```

The file `display.sh` should no longer appear.

---

## üîπ **8. List the files in /etc directory in the ascending order of their access time**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `ls` command with appropriate options to sort by access time.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
ls -ltu /etc
```

- `-l` = long listing format
- `-t` = sort by modification time (but combined with `-u`, sorts by access time)
- `-u` = use access time for sorting

> This lists files sorted by when they were last accessed, newest first.

---

## üîπ **9. Copy the file /var/log/bootstrap.log to your current directory**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `cp` command to copy a file from its source path to the current directory.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cp /var/log/bootstrap.log .
```

To verify:

```bash
ls
```

You should see `bootstrap.log` in your current directory.

Great job completing these hands-on exercises! You're now comfortable with basic file and directory management in Linux.

Would you like to continue with **Exercise 4 ‚Äì Working with Archives and Compression**, or dive into **permissions and ownership**? Just say the word ‚Äî I'm here to guide you further! üêßüì¶üîí‚ú®

### USER

Security: Managing File Permissions and Ownership
Learning objectives
After completing this reading, you will be able to:

Explain file ownership and permissions
View file and directory permissions
Make a file private
Why do we need file permissions and ownership?
Linux is a multi-user operating system. This means that by default, other users will be able to view any files you store on the system. However, you may have some files, such as your personal tax documents or your employer's intellectual property documents, that are private or confidential. How can you protect these sensitive documents from being viewed or modified by others?

File ownership and permissions
There are three possible levels of file ownership in Linux: user, group, and other.
Whoever creates a file, namely the user at the time of creation, becomes the owner of that file by default. A group of users can also share ownership of a file. The other category essentially refers to anyone in the universe with access to your Linux machine ‚Äì Exercise caution when assigning ownership permission to this level!

Only an official owner of a file is allowed to change its permissions. This means that only owners can decide who can read the file, write to it, or execute it.

Viewing file permissions
Let's say you've entered the following lines of code:

1
2
3
4
5
$ echo "Who can read this file?" > my_new_file
$ more my_new_file
Who can read this file?
$ ls -l my_new_file
-rw-r--r-- 1 theia users 25 Dec 22 17:47 x

Copied!
Here we've echoed the string "Who can read this file?" into a new file called my_new_file. The next line uses the more command to print the contents of the new file. Finally, the ls command with the -l option displays the file's (default) permissions: rw-r--r--

The first three characters (rw-) define the user permissions, the next three (r--) the group permissions, and the final three (r--) the other permissions.

So you, being the user, have the permission rw-, which means you have read and write permissions by default, but do not have execution permissions. Otherwise, there would be an x in place of the last -.

Thus by looking at the entire line, rw-r--r--, you can see that anyone can read the file, nobody can execute it, and you are the only user that can write to it.

Note: The - at the very beginning of the line in the terminal means that the permissions are referring to a file. If you were getting the permissions to a directory, you would see a d in the front for "directory".

Directory permissions
The permissions for directories are similar but distinct for files. Though directories use the same rwx format, the symbols have slightly different meanings.

The following table illustrates the meanings of each permission for directories:

Directory Permission Permissible action(s)
r List directory contents using ls command
w Add or remove files or directories
x Enter directory using cd command
Setting appropriate permissions on directories is a best practice for both security and stability reasons. Though this reading focuses on security, you will learn more about other reasons for setting file permissions and ownership later in this course.

Making a file private
You can revoke read permissions from your group and all other users by using the chmod command. Ensure successful modification by using the ls -l command again:

1
2
3
chmod go-r my_new_file
ls -l my_new_file
-rw------- 1 theia users 24 Dec 22 18:49 my_new_file

Copied!
In the chmod command, go-r is the permission change to be applied, which in this case means removing for the group (g) and others (o) the read (r) permission. The chmod command can be used with both files and directories.

Executable files - looking ahead
You've learned what it means to read or write to a file, but what does it mean to have permissions to execute a file in Linux?

A Linux file is executable if it contains instructions that can be directly interpreted by the operating system. Basically, an executable file is a ready-to-run program. They're also referred to as binaries or executables.

In this course, you will become very familiar with a particular kind of executable called a script, which is a program written in a scripting language. You'll learn all about shell scripting, or more specifically Bash scripting, which is writing scripts in Bash (Bourne Again Shell), a very popular shell scripting language. A shell script is a plain text file that can be interpreted by a shell.

Formally speaking, for a text file to be considered an executable shell script for a given user, it needs to have two things:

Execute permissions set for that user
A directive, called a "shebang", in its first line to declare itself to the operating system as a binary
All of this will become more clear to you soon when we get to the topic of shell scripting.

Summary
In this reading, you learned that:

There are three possible levels of file ownership in Linux - user, group, and other - which determine who can read, write to, and execute a file.
You can use the ls -l command to view file and directory permissions.
You can change permissions on a file by using the chmod command.

### ASSISTANT

### üîí **Security: Managing File Permissions and Ownership ‚Äì Summary & Guide**

In this reading, you learned how to manage **file permissions** and **ownership** in Linux ‚Äî a crucial skill for protecting sensitive data and ensuring system security.

---

## üéØ **Learning Objectives Recap**

By the end of this section, you should be able to:

- Explain file ownership and permissions
- View file and directory permissions
- Make files private by changing permission settings

---

## üîê Why File Permissions Matter

Linux is a **multi-user operating system**, which means multiple people can access the same machine. Without proper permissions:

- Anyone could **read or modify your files**
- Malicious users might **execute harmful scripts**
- Sensitive documents (like tax records or company IP) could be **exposed**

That‚Äôs why **permissions and ownership** allow fine-grained control over who can read, write, or execute files.

---

## üë§ Types of Owners in Linux

There are **three categories** of users that determine permission levels:

| Category      | Meaning                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **user (u)**  | The owner of the file (usually the creator) |
| **group (g)** | A group of users assigned to the file       |
| **other (o)** | Everyone else with access to the system     |

Each category has its own set of permissions:

- `r` = Read
- `w` = Write
- `x` = Execute

---

## üëÄ Viewing File Permissions

Use:

```bash
ls -l filename
```

Example output:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 theia users 25 Dec 22 17:47 my_new_file
```

- `-`: Indicates it's a regular file
- `rw-`: User (owner) permissions
- `r--`: Group permissions
- `r--`: Others' permissions

üìò For directories:

- `d` at the start indicates it's a directory
- Permissions mean:
  - `r`: Can list contents (`ls`)
  - `w`: Can create or delete files inside
  - `x`: Can enter the directory (`cd`)

---

## üîß Changing File Permissions with `chmod`

You can change permissions using:

```bash
chmod [options] filename
```

### Example: Make a file private

```bash
chmod go-r my_new_file
```

This removes **read** permission for **group** and **others**.

After running:

```bash
ls -l my_new_file
```

You'll see:

```
-rw------- 1 theia users 24 Dec 22 18:49 my_new_file
```

Now only the **owner** can read and write to the file.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only the **owner** or **root** can change permissions on a file.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Common `chmod` Syntax Options

| Command               | Action                                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `chmod u+x file.sh`   | Add execute permission for the user          |
| `chmod go-w file.txt` | Remove write permission for group and others |
| `chmod 755 file.sh`   | Set numeric permissions (see below)          |

### Numeric Permission Notation

Each permission level has a number value:

- `r` = 4
- `w` = 2
- `x` = 1

Sum them to get numeric values:

| Permission | Value |
| ---------- | ----- |
| `rwx`      | 7     |
| `rw-`      | 6     |
| `r-x`      | 5     |
| `r--`      | 4     |

Example:

```bash
chmod 600 secret.txt
```

Only the owner has **read and write** access.

---

## üìÅ Executable Files and Shell Scripts

To make a shell script executable:

1. Add a **shebang** line at the top:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   ```
2. Give it execute permission:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
   ```
3. Run it:
   ```bash
   ./script.sh
   ```

This tells the OS that the file is a program written in Bash (or another interpreter).

| Concept                | Description                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **User (u)**           | Owner of the file                              |
| **Group (g)**          | Group of users who share ownership             |

| **Permissions**        | `r` = read, `w` = write, `x` = execute         |
| **View Permissions**   | `ls -l`                                        |
| **Change Permissions** | `chmod`                                        |
| **Make Private**       | `chmod go-rwx filename`                        |
| **Numeric Mode**       | `chmod 600 filename`                           |
| **Directories**        | `r` = list, `w` = modify contents, `x` = enter |

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Use `chmod 700 folder` to keep a directory private
- Protect sensitive scripts with `chmod 600 script.sh`
- Use `id` to see what groups you belong to
- Use `chown` (as root) to change file ownership

2
cd /home/project
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-LX0117EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/module%201/usdoi.txt

Copied!
Each file and each directory in your Linux system has permissions set for three permission categories: the 'user', the 'group', and 'all users' (or 'other').

The following permissions are set for each file and directory:

Permission Symbol
read r
write w
execute x
To see the permissions currently set for a file, run the ls command with the -l option.

For example, to see the permissions for the file named usdoi.txt in your current directory, enter the following:

1
ls -l usdoi.txt

Copied!
A sample output looks like the following:

-rw-r--r-- 1 theia theia 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt

The permissions set here are rw-r--r--. The - preceeding these permissions indicates that usdoi.txt is a file. If it were a directory, you would see a d instead of the -.

The first three entries correspond to the current user, the next three correspond to the group, and the last three are for all others. You can see the user has read and write permissions, while the user group only has read permission, and all other users have only read permission. No users have execute permission, as indicated by the - instead of an x in the third position for each user category.

1.2 Change file access permissions
chmod

The chmod or change mode command lets you change the permissions set for a file.

Specify which permissions to change with a combination of the following characters:

Option Description
r, w, x Permissions: read, write, and execute
u,g, o User categories: user, group, and all others
+, - Operations: grant and revoke
The following command revokes read permissions for all users (user, group, and other) on the file usdoi.txt:

1
chmod -r usdoi.txt

Copied!
You can verify the changed permissions by entering:

1
ls -l usdoi.txt

Copied!
To grant read access to all users on usdoi.txt, enter:

1
chmod +r usdoi.txt

Copied!
Verify the changed permissions again with the following:

1
ls -l usdoi.txt

Copied!
Now to remove the read permission only for 'other' category, enter the following:

1
chmod o-r usdoi.txt

Copied!
Verify the changed permissions as follows:

1
ls -l usdoi.txt

### üõ†Ô∏è Exercise 1 - Viewing and Modifying File Access Permissions

In this exercise, you learned how to **view** and **modify file permissions** in Linux using the `ls -l` and `chmod` commands. Understanding and managing permissions is essential for maintaining system security and controlling access to your files.

---

## üìÅ 1.1 View File Access Permissions

### üîß Steps:

1. Navigate to your project directory:

   ```bash
   cd /home/project
   ```

2. Download the required file:

   ```bash
   wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-LX0117EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/module%201/usdoi.txt
   ```

3. View the file's permissions:
   ```bash
   ls -l usdoi.txt
   ```

### ‚úÖ Sample Output:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 theia theia 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

### üìù Breakdown of Permission String: `-rw-r--r--`

| Part  | Meaning                                       |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `-`   | It's a regular file (use `d` for directories) |
| `rw-` | User (owner) has **read** and **write**       |
| `r--` | Group has only **read**                       |
| `r--` | Others have only **read**                     |

---

## üîê 1.2 Change File Access Permissions with `chmod`

The `chmod` command allows you to modify who can **read**, **write**, or **execute** a file.

### üîß Syntax:

```bash
chmod [who][operator][permission] filename
```

| Component    | Values                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `who`        | `u` = user, `g` = group, `o` = others, `a` = all |
| `operator`   | `+` = add, `-` = remove, `=` = set exactly       |
| `permission` | `r` = read, `w` = write, `x` = execute           |

---

### üîç Example Commands

#### ‚ùå Remove read permission for all users:

```bash
chmod -r usdoi.txt
```

Verify:

```bash
ls -l usdoi.txt
```

You'll see something like:

```
--w------- 1 theia theia 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

#### ‚úÖ Restore read permission for all users:

```bash
chmod +r usdoi.txt
```

Verify:

```bash
ls -l usdoi.txt
```

You should return to:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 theia theia 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

#### üö´ Remove read permission only for "other":

```bash
chmod o-r usdoi.txt
```

Verify:

```bash
ls -l usdoi.txt
```

Now output will be:

```
-rw-r----- 1 theia theia 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

Only **user** and **group** can read the file now.

## üß† Summary Table

| Task                                    | Command              |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| View file permissions                   | `ls -l filename`     |
| Remove read from all                    | `chmod -r filename`  |
| Add read to all                         | `chmod +r filename`  |
| Remove read from others                 | `chmod o-r filename` |
| Add execute to user                     | `chmod u+x filename` |
| Set exact permissions (e.g., rw-------) | `chmod 600 filename` |

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Use **numeric mode** for precision:
  ```bash
  chmod 644 usdoi.txt    # rw-r--r--
  chmod 700 secret.sh     # rwx------
  ```
- Always double-check permissions on sensitive files:
  ```bash
  ls -l secret.txt
  ```
- Only the **file owner** or **root** can change permissions.

Exercise 2 - Understanding directory access permissions
2.1 View default directory access permissions
Recall the following table, which illustrates the meanings of each permission for directories with examples of allowable operations for a given directory.

Directory Permission Permissible action(s)
r list directory contents using ls command
w add/remove files or directories from directory
x enter directory using cd command
For this exercise, first move to your project directory and create a new directory called test:

1
2
cd /home/project
mkdir test

Copied!
Check the default permissions that the system sets for your new test directory:

1
ls -l

Copied!
As you can see from the resulting output:

1
2
3
total 12
drwxr-sr-x 2 theia users 4096 May 15 14:06 test
-rw-r----- 1 theia users 8121 Sep 28 2022 usdoi.txt

Copied!
You, "theia", as the owner of test, have read, write, and execute permissions set by default. But all others only have read and execute permissions set and cannot write to your test directory. This means users outside your group can't add or remove files from test. They can, however, explore your directory to see what files and directories exist there.

Note: You might be wondering what that s permission is in the execute slot for your group. The s stands for "special permission". It means that any new files created within the directory will have their group ownership set to be the same as the directory owner. We won't go into this level of detail in this course, but you can learn more about advanced Linux permissions here: Linux permissions: SUID, SGID, and sticky bit.

Go ahead and verify for yourself that you have permission to run the following commands. Change the directory to your test directory, create a new directory within it, then return to your parent directory:

1
2
3
cd test
mkdir test2
cd ../

Copied!
2.2 Remove user execute permissions on your test directory
Remove your user execute permissions on test using the following command:

1
chmod u-x test

Copied!
Now, what happens when you try to change directories to test?

1
cd test

Copied!
You get an error message!

bash: cd: test: Permission denied

As you just removed execute permissions for yourself on your test directory, you can no longer make it your present working directory. However, you can still "read" it with the ls command:

1
ls -l

Copied!
Even though you have "write" permissions set, you can't actually create a new directory within test, because removing execute permissions overrides write permissions. For example, entering,

1
mkdir test/test3

Copied!
throws an error:

mkdir: cannot create directory ‚Äòtest/test‚Äô: Permission denied

This time, try restoring execute permissions on test and denying write permissions. Then verify your changes:

1
2
3
chmod u+x test
chmod u-w test
ls -l

Copied!
Now you can go into test, but you still can't write to it! Entering

1
2
cd test
mkdir test_again

Copied!
throws the error:

mkdir: cannot create directory ‚Äòtest_again‚Äô: Permission denied

### ASSISTANT

### üìÅ Exercise 2 - Understanding Directory Access Permissions

In this exercise, you explored how **directory permissions** in Linux work and how they differ from file permissions. You learned that **execute (`x`) permission is required to enter a directory**, and **write (`w`) permission is needed to create or delete files inside it**.

---

## üîç Summary of What You Learned

| Permission    | Meaning for Directories                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `r` (read)    | Allows listing contents with `ls`        |
| `w` (write)   | Allows adding/removing files             |
| `x` (execute) | Allows entering the directory using `cd` |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Even if you have write access, you can't modify contents without execute permission!

---

## üßæ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 2.1 View Default Directory Access Permissions

#### Create a new directory:

```bash
cd /home/project
mkdir test
```

#### Check its permissions:

```bash
ls -l
```

Output example:

```
drwxr-sr-x 2 theia users 4096 May 15 14:06 test
```

- `d`: Indicates it's a directory
- `rwx`: Owner (user) has read, write, and execute
- `r-s`: Group has read and setgid (special permission)
- `r-x`: Others have read and execute

You verified that:

- You could enter the directory
- You could create a subdirectory inside it

Commands used:

```bash
cd test
mkdir test2
cd ..
```

> üí° The `s` in group permissions is a special flag called **setgid** ‚Äî it ensures new files inherit the group of the parent directory.

---

### üîπ 2.2 Remove User Execute Permissions

#### Remove execute permission for owner:

```bash
chmod u-x test
```

Now try:

```bash
cd test
```

‚ùå Output:

```
bash: cd: test: Permission denied
```

Even though you still have read and write permissions, **you can't enter the directory** without execute permission.

Try listing contents:

```bash
ls -l test
```

‚úÖ Works ‚Äî because you still have **read** permission.

Try creating a subdirectory:

```bash
mkdir test/test3
```

‚ùå Fails ‚Äî because **write requires execute**.

---

### üîÅ Restore Permissions

#### Add back execute:

```bash
chmod u+x test
```

#### Remove write:

```bash
chmod u-w test
```

Check current permissions:

```bash
ls -l
```

Now try:

```bash
cd test
mkdir test_again
```

‚ùå Output:

```
mkdir: cannot create directory ‚Äòtest_again‚Äô: Permission denied
```

You can **enter** the directory (thanks to `x`), but you **can't modify** it (because you don‚Äôt have `w`).

---

## üß† Key Takeaways

| Scenario               | Required Permission                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| List contents (`ls`)   | `r`                                             |
| Enter directory (`cd`) | `x`                                             |
| Create/delete files    | `w` + `x`                                       |
| Rename or move files   | `w` + `x` in both source and target directories |

> üß© Think of `x` as a key to open a door ‚Äî you need it before you can do anything useful inside a directory.

| `ls -l`            | Show directory permissions                                |
| `chmod u+x dir`    | Allow user to enter directory                             |
| `chmod u-w dir`    | Prevent user from modifying directory contents            |
| `cd dir`           | Requires execute (`x`) permission                         |
| `ls dir`           | Requires read (`r`) permission                            |
| `mkdir dir/subdir` | Requires write (`w`) + execute (`x`) permissions on `dir` |

### üõ†Ô∏è **Practice Exercises ‚Äì File and Directory Permissions**

Here are the **practice exercises** with hints and full solutions to help you reinforce your understanding of Linux file and directory permissions.

---

## üîπ **1. List the permissions set for the file `usdoi.txt`**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `ls -l` command to view file permissions.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
ls -l usdoi.txt
```

Example output:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 theia users 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

This shows that:

- The owner has **read and write**
- The group has **read**
- Others have **read**

---

## üîπ **2. Revoke the write permission on `usdoi.txt` for the user, and verify**

### üí° Hint:

Use `chmod u-w` to remove write access for the user.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
chmod u-w usdoi.txt
ls -l usdoi.txt
```

New output:

```
-r--r--r-- 1 theia users 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

The user (owner) no longer has **write** permission.

---

## üîπ **3. What happens if you try to delete `usdoi.txt` after revoking write permissions?**

### üí° Hint:

You don‚Äôt need write permission to delete a file ‚Äî but you **do** need write permission in the **directory** it‚Äôs in.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

Try deleting:

```bash
rm usdoi.txt
```

‚úÖ It works!  
Even though you removed write permission **on the file**, you can still delete it because:

- You own the file
- You have **write permission in the directory**

> üîç Note: If you didn‚Äôt own the file, you could still delete it as long as:
>
> - You had **write** permission in the directory
> - You didn't own the file

---

## üîπ **4. Create a new directory called `tmp_dir` in your home directory**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `mkdir` command.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir tmp_dir
```

Now you have a new directory in your home folder.

---

## üîπ **5. View the permissions of the newly created directory `tmp_dir`**

### üí° Hint:

Use `ls -l` again to see directory permissions.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
ls -l
```

Output will include something like:

```
drwxr-xr-x 2 theia users 4096 Apr 5 10:00 tmp_dir
```

This means:

- User: read, write, execute
- Group: read, execute
- Others: read, execute

---

## üîπ **6. Revoke the user write permission for `tmp_dir`**

### üí° Hint:

Use `chmod u-w` on the directory.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
chmod u-w tmp_dir
ls -l
```

New output:

```
dr-xr-xr-x 2 theia users 4096 Apr 5 10:00 tmp_dir
```

User now only has **execute** and **read** ‚Äî not **write**.

---

## üîπ **7. Check whether you can create a subdirectory `sub_dir` inside `tmp_dir`**

### üí° Hint:

Use `mkdir` to attempt creating a subdirectory.

### ‚úÖ Solution 1:

```bash
mkdir tmp_dir/sub_dir
```

‚ùå Output:

```
mkdir: cannot create directory ‚Äòtmp_dir/sub_dir‚Äô: Permission denied
```

### ‚úÖ Solution 2 Explanation:

Even though you have **execute** (`x`) permission on `tmp_dir`, which allows you to **enter** the directory, you **don‚Äôt have write** (`w`) permission ‚Äî so you **can't modify** its contents (like creating or deleting files or directories).

Great job working through these permission exercises! You're building strong skills in managing **file access control**, **user permissions**, and **directory behavior** in Linux.

### USER

Exercise 1 - Viewing file contents
cat
more
less

In this exercise, you will learn how to explore file contents using the cat, more, and less commands to display the file contents in your terminal window.

Begin by changing directories to your default home directory, ~, or \home\theia:

1
cd ~

Copied!
Using the ls command, you should see a file called entrypoint.sh. The .sh is a convention used to identify a text file as being a shell script.

Next, let's take a look inside this file.

1.1. Viewing file content with the cat command
The cat command displays the contents of the file and exits back to the command prompt as follows:

1
cat entrypoint.sh

Copied!
It only displays the tail end of the file, so if the file is too long to fit on the terminal, you won't be able to see some of its contents.

Although the cat command may not be the best way to view the contents of a file, especially larger files, it is quite useful for shell scripting applications. For example, it is often used to concatenate, or append one file onto another.

1.2. Viewing file content with the more command
A better alternative to the cat command for viewing file contents is the more command. By entering the following command:

1
more entrypoint.sh

Copied!
you will see the top portion of the file first.

Tip: The first line of this particular file, #!/bin/bash, is called a shebang. Basically, this shebang line makes the file a bash script by invoking the bash shell. You will learn more about shebang lines later in this course.

When using the more command, you can see only as many lines as will fit on your terminal window at once.

To see the next portion of the file, just press your spacebar. You can keep paging this way, tapping the spacebar until you reach the end of the file. Once you reach the last page, you will exit back to the command prompt.

Another way to exit is simply to type q, which quits and returns to the command prompt.

1.3. Scrolling through file content with the less command
What if you want to move up and down through the file, not just downward? In this case, you can use the less command:

1
less entrypoint.sh

Copied!
Just like more, the less command displays the first page of the file. What's useful about less is that you can use it to move around the file, page by page, using the Page Up and Page Down keys.

You can also scroll up and down through the file line-by-line, using the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys, ‚Üë and ‚Üì.

Unlike more, less does not automatically exit when you reach the end of a file, allowing you the option to continue scrolling around. You can quit at any time by typing q.

### ASSISTANT

# üìÑ Exercise 1 - Viewing File Contents with `cat`, `more`, and `less`

In this exercise, you learned how to **view and navigate file contents** in the terminal using three essential Linux commands:

- `cat` ‚Äì for quick viewing and concatenation
- `more` ‚Äì for basic scrolling through a file
- `less` ‚Äì for advanced navigation (forward and backward)

These tools are especially useful when working with shell scripts, logs, configuration files, and other text-based data.

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üèÅ Start by navigating to your home directory:

```bash
cd ~
```

### üîç Check what files exist:

```bash
ls
```

You should see a file named `entrypoint.sh`. `.sh` is the extension used for **shell scripts**, which are executable text files that contain Bash commands.

---

## ‚úÖ 1.1 View File Content with `cat`

### Command:

```bash
cat entrypoint.sh
```

### What It Does:

- Displays the **entire contents** of the file at once
- Stops at the end and returns to the command prompt

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If the file is longer than your terminal window, you‚Äôll only see the last part ‚Äî it scrolls past too quickly to read everything.

### üí° Use Cases:

- Quick inspection of small files
- Concatenating multiple files:
  ```bash
  cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt
  ```

---

## ‚úÖ 1.2 View File Content with `more`

### Command:

```bash
more entrypoint.sh
```

### What It Does:

- Shows one screen of text at a time
- Press **Spacebar** to go to the next page
- Type **q** to quit

### üîç Useful Info:

The first line:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

is called a **shebang** ‚Äî it tells the system to use `/bin/bash` to interpret the script.

> üìå You‚Äôll learn more about writing shell scripts later in the course.

### üí° Use Cases:

- Reading medium-sized files
- Viewing logs or configuration files from the command line

---

## ‚úÖ 1.3 Scroll Through File Content with `less`

### Command:

```bash
less entrypoint.sh
```

### What It Does:

- Displays one screen of content
- Allows **scrolling forward and backward**
  - **‚Üë / ‚Üì** keys: scroll line by line
  - **Page Up / Page Down**: scroll page by page
- Press **q** to exit

### üÜï Why `less` Is Better Than `more`:

- You can move **up and down**, not just down
- You can search inside the file with `/search_term`
- It doesn‚Äôt automatically quit at the end

---

## üìã Summary Table

| Command | Scrolling Direction   | Interactive | Exits Automatically | Best For                  |
| ------- | --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `cat`   | All at once           | No          | Yes                 | Small files, scripting    |
| `more`  | Forward only          | Limited     | Yes                 | Paging through files      |
| `less`  | Both forward/backward | Full        | No                  | Detailed inspection, logs |

---

## üß† Tips & Tricks

- Combine with pipes to view output:
  ```bash
  ls -l /etc | less

Exercise 2 - Viewing text file contents
In this exercise, you will work with a few more commands for viewing the content of text files.

To begin, run the following commands:

1
2
cd /home/project
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0250EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Bash%20Scripting/usdoi.txt

Copied!
The wget command downloads a text file called usdoi.txt from the provided URL. You'll see this command again later in the context of networking commands. You can check to see if you successfully downloaded the usdoi.txt by using the ls command.

2.1. Display the first N lines of a file
head

By default, head will print the first 10 lines of a file. To use it with usdoi.txt, enter the following:

1
head usdoi.txt

Copied!
You can also specify the number of lines to be printed. Print only the first 3 lines of text from the file usdoi.txt by entering:

1
head -3 usdoi.txt

Copied!
2.2. Display the last N lines of a file
tail

By default, tail will print the last 10 lines of the file usdoi.txt:

1
tail usdoi.txt

Copied!
Just like with head, you can specify the number of lines to be printed. Print the last 2 lines of the file usdoi.txt by entering the following:

1
tail -2 usdoi.txt

### ASSISTANT

# üìÑ Exercise 2 - Viewing Text File Contents

## Using `head` and `tail` to View File Content

In this exercise, you learned how to **inspect specific parts of a text file** using two powerful Linux commands:

- `head` ‚Äì to view the **beginning** of a file
- `tail` ‚Äì to view the **end** of a file

These tools are especially useful for:

- Reading large log files
- Monitoring real-time updates (with `tail -f`)
- Extracting headers or footers from data files

---

## üßæ Step-by-Step Instructions

### üîß Download and Navigate to Your Project Directory:

```bash
cd /home/project
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0250EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Bash%20Scripting/usdoi.txt
```

Verify the file was downloaded:

```bash
ls
```

You should see `usdoi.txt` listed.

---

## ‚úÖ 2.1 Display the First N Lines with `head`

### Show the first 10 lines (default):

```bash
head usdoi.txt
```

This is helpful when viewing large documents like logs or configuration files where the most important info may be at the top.

### Show only the first 3 lines:

```bash
head -3 usdoi.txt
```

Example output:

```
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another...
```

> üí° Use `head` to quickly preview files without opening the entire contents.

---

## ‚úÖ 2.2 Display the Last N Lines with `tail`

### Show the last 10 lines (default):

```bash
tail usdoi.txt
```

Useful for checking the end of logs or files where recent changes are appended.

### Show only the last 2 lines:

```bash
tail -2 usdoi.txt
```

Example output:

```
...and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.
```

> üöÄ Pro Tip: Use `tail -f` to follow a log file in real time:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

### ASSISTANT

# üìä Exercise 3 - Getting Basic Text File Stats with `wc`

In this exercise, you learned how to use the **`wc`** (word count) command to get basic statistics about a text file ‚Äî including the number of **lines**, **words**, and **characters**.

This is especially useful when:

- You're analyzing large text files
- You need to verify file contents before processing
- You're writing scripts that depend on file size or structure

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Breakdown

### Start by navigating to your project directory and using `wc`:

```bash
cd /home/project
wc usdoi.txt
```

### Example Output:

```
     21     268    1654 usdoi.txt
```

The output shows:

1. Number of **lines**
2. Number of **words**
3. Number of **characters**
4. File name

---

## ‚úÖ View Specific Stats

### üî¢ Count Lines Only:

```bash
wc -l usdoi.txt
```

Useful for checking how many entries are in a list or log file.

---

### üìù Count Words Only:

```bash
wc -w usdoi.txt
```

Great for content analysis or verifying document length.

---

### üî§ Count Characters Only:

```bash
wc -c usdoi.txt
```

Tells you the total byte size of the file ‚Äî useful for storage and transmission planning.

> üí° Note: `wc -c` counts bytes, not just visible characters ‚Äî so whitespace and punctuation are included.

---

## üìã Summary Table

| Command          | Output                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `wc filename`    | Lines, words, characters     |
| `wc -l filename` | Number of lines              |
| `wc -w filename` | Number of words              |
| `wc -c filename` | Number of bytes (characters) |

---

## üß† Why `wc` Is Useful

- **Automation**: Use in scripts to validate input data size
- **Analysis**: Get quick stats without opening the file
- **Debugging**: Check if a file has expected content structure

---

You're doing great! With these tools, you can now **analyze text files efficiently** and extract meaningful insights from their content.

Exercise 4 - Basic text wrangling: sorting lines and dropping duplicates
4.1. Sort and display lines of file alphanumerically
sort

You can use the sort command to display the lines of a file sorted alphanumerically.

To view the lines of usdoi.txt sorted alphanumerically, enter:

1
sort usdoi.txt

Copied!
To view those lines sorted in reverse order, enter:

1
sort -r usdoi.txt

Copied!
4.2. Drop consecutive duplicated lines and display result
uniq

First download the following file:

1
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-LX0117EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/module%201/zoo.txt

Copied!
View the raw contents of zoo.txt with the cat command:

1
cat zoo.txt

Copied!
View the contents of zoo.txt with identical, consecutive lines dropped using the uniq command:

1
uniq zoo.txt

Copied!
The uniq line will drop any lines in the file that are identical and consecutive. This is similar to what is known as "dropping duplicates". As you can see from this example, however, there can still be duplicated lines left over if these lines are not repeated right after the other.

### ASSISTANT

# üßπ Exercise 4 - Basic Text Wrangling: Sorting Lines and Dropping Duplicates

In this exercise, you learned how to **clean up and organize text data** using two powerful Linux utilities:

- `sort` ‚Äì to **alphabetically or numerically sort lines**
- `uniq` ‚Äì to **remove consecutive duplicate lines**

These tools are essential for:

- Data cleaning
- Log file analysis
- Preparing input for scripts
- Removing redundant output

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Breakdown

### ‚úÖ 4.1 Sort Lines Alphanumerically with `sort`

#### Display the lines of `usdoi.txt` sorted alphanumerically:

```bash
sort usdoi.txt
```

This command rearranges all the lines in alphabetical order (A‚ÄìZ), making it easier to scan or analyze content.

#### Sort in reverse order (Z‚ÄìA):

```bash
sort -r usdoi.txt
```

> üí° This is useful when you want to see the "end" of an alphabetized list first ‚Äî like viewing the latest entries in a log.

---

### ‚úÖ 4.2 Remove Consecutive Duplicate Lines with `uniq`

#### First, download a new file:

```bash
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-LX0117EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/module%201/zoo.txt
```

#### View the contents:

```bash
cat zoo.txt
```

You‚Äôll notice some repeated animal names, especially `zebra`.

#### Remove **consecutive duplicates**:

```bash
uniq zoo.txt
```

This removes only lines that appear **one after another**, so:

```
zebra
zebra
lion
tiger
zebra
```

Becomes:

```
zebra
lion
tiger
zebra
```

Only the **first two zebras** are removed as duplicates ‚Äî the last one stays because it's not directly after another zebra.

---

## üìã Summary Table

| Command            | Description                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `sort filename`    | Sort lines alphabetically              |
| `sort -r filename` | Sort lines in reverse order            |
| `uniq filename`    | Remove **consecutive** duplicate lines |
| `sort file         | uniq`                                  | Sort then remove all duplicates (if grouped) |

---

## üß† Pro Tips

- To remove **all duplicate lines** regardless of order:

  ```bash
  sort zoo.txt | uniq
  ```

- Count how many times each line appears:

  ```bash
  sort zoo.txt | uniq -c
  ```

- Show only lines that appear **more than once**:

  ```bash
  sort zoo.txt | uniq -d
  ```

- Show only lines that appear **exactly once**:
  ```bash
  sort zoo.txt | uniq -u
  ```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Use Cases

| Task                              | Command                      |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Clean up a messy list of emails   | `sort emails.txt             | uniq > clean_emails.txt` |
| Count unique IP addresses in logs | `cut -d' ' -f1 access.log    | sort                     | uniq -c` |
| Find most frequently visited URLs | `awk '{print $7}' access.log | sort                     | uniq -c  | sort -nr | head -n 10` |

Great job mastering these basic but powerful text processing tools! You're now equipped to **organize**, **clean**, and **analyze** textual data efficiently in Linux.

Ready to move on to **Exercise 5 ‚Äì Searching Inside Files with `grep`**?  
Just let me know and I‚Äôll guide you through searching for specific patterns and words inside files! üêßüìÑüîçüßπ‚ú®

### USER

Exercise 5 - Basic text wrangling: extracting lines and fields
5.1. Extract lines matching a specified criterion
grep

The grep command allows you to specify a pattern and search for lines within a file that match that pattern.

For example, the following command prints all lines in the file usdoi.txt which contain the word people:

1
grep people usdoi.txt

Copied!
Some frequently used options for grep include:

Option Description
-n Along with the matching lines, also print the line numbers
-c Get the count of matching lines
-i Ignore the case of the text while matching
-v Print all lines which do not contain the pattern
-w Match only if the pattern matches whole words
You can use these options to print all the lines from the /etc/passwd file which do not contain the pattern login:

1
grep -v login /etc/passwd

Copied!
5.2. Extract fields from lines of text
cut

The cut command allows you to view only specific fields from each line of text in a file.

For example, you can use cut with the -c option to view only the first two characters of each line:

1
cut -c -2 zoo.txt

Copied!
Or to view each line starting from the second character:

1
cut -c 2- zoo.txt

Copied!
The cut command can also be used to extract a field from a delimited file.
To demonstrate this, start by downloading and taking a look at the following comma-separated file:

1
2
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-LX0117EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/v4_new_content/labs/names_and_numbers.csv  
cat names_and_numbers.csv

Copied!
Now you can extract just the phone numbers for each person listed in the file using the -d (delimiter) and f (field) options as follows:

1
cut -d "," -f2 names_and_numbers.csv

Copied!
-d "," tells the command that the delimiter is a comma, and -f2 tells it to extract the second field.

### ASSISTANT

# üß© Exercise 5 - Basic Text Wrangling: Extracting Lines and Fields

In this exercise, you learned how to **filter lines** using patterns with `grep` and **extract specific parts of text** using the `cut` command.

These tools are essential for:

- Searching through logs
- Filtering data
- Processing structured files like CSVs
- Automating repetitive tasks in scripts

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Breakdown

### ‚úÖ 5.1 Extract Lines Matching a Pattern with `grep`

#### Print all lines containing the word "people":

```bash
grep people usdoi.txt
```

This shows only the lines where the word `people` appears.

#### Print matching lines along with line numbers:

```bash
grep -n people usdoi.txt
```

#### Count how many lines contain the pattern:

```bash
grep -c people usdoi.txt
```

#### Ignore case (match both "People" and "people"):

```bash
grep -i people usdoi.txt
```

#### Show lines that **do not** contain the pattern:

```bash
grep -v login /etc/passwd
```

Useful for filtering out system-generated accounts from `/etc/passwd`.

#### Match only whole words:

```bash
grep -w people usdoi.txt
```

Prevents partial matches like `peoples` or `unpeople`.

---

### ‚úÖ 5.2 Extract Fields from Lines Using `cut`

#### View first two characters of each line in `zoo.txt`:

```bash
cut -c -2 zoo.txt
```

#### View text starting from the second character:

```bash
cut -c 2- zoo.txt
```

> These options extract by **character position**, useful for fixed-width formats.

---

### üì• Work with Delimited Files (e.g., CSV)

#### Download and view the file:

```bash
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-LX0117EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/v4_new_content/labs/names_and_numbers.csv
cat names_and_numbers.csv
```

Sample content:

```
Name,Phone
Alice,555-1234
Bob,555-5678
Charlie,555-9012
```

#### Extract just the phone numbers (second field):

```bash
cut -d "," -f2 names_and_numbers.csv
```

- `-d ","` tells `cut` to split on commas
- `-f2` tells it to return the second field

Output:

```
Phone
555-1234
555-5678
555-9012
```

You can also extract multiple fields:

```bash
cut -d "," -f1,3 names_and_numbers.csv
```

Returns fields 1 and 3 ‚Äî useful when skipping unnecessary columns.

## üß† Why These Tools Matter

| Tool   | Use Case                                                       |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `grep` | Search, filter, and count patterns in text                     |
| `cut`  | Extract specific parts of text based on position or delimiters |

They're often used together in pipelines:

```bash
grep "New York" contacts.csv | cut -d "," -f2
```

This finds all entries for New York and extracts their phone numbers.

### ASSISTANT

# üß© Exercise 6 - Basic Text Wrangling: Merging Lines as Fields

In this exercise, you learned how to use the **`paste`** command to **merge lines from multiple files side-by-side**, like combining columns in a spreadsheet.

This is especially useful when:

- You're working with related data stored in separate files
- You want to align rows for analysis or reporting
- You need to build structured output from flat files

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Breakdown

### ‚úÖ Download an additional file:

```bash
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-LX0117EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/module%201/zoo_ages.txt
```

You already have `zoo.txt`, which contains animal names. Now `zoo_ages.txt` has corresponding age data.

### ‚úÖ Merge both files line-by-line using `paste`:

```bash
paste zoo.txt zoo_ages.txt
```

By default, `paste` uses a **Tab (`\t`)** character to separate merged fields.

Example Output:

```
lion	5
tiger	4
zebra	6
elephant	10
```

This makes it easy to combine related data into a single view.

---

### ‚úÖ Change the Delimiter to Comma (`,`) for CSV-like Output:

```bash
paste -d "," zoo.txt zoo_ages.txt
```

Now the output looks like:

```
lion,5
tiger,4
zebra,6
elephant,10
```

> üí° This is useful for creating CSV files or preparing data for scripts and databases.

You can also use other delimiters like space, colon, or semicolon:

```bash
paste -d " " zoo.txt zoo_ages.txt   # Space
paste -d ":" zoo.txt zoo_ages.txt  # Colon
```

grep "not installed" /var/log/bootstrap.log
```

This helps identify packages or services that failed to install during system boot.

---

### 3. **Find websites with "org" in them from `top-sites.txt`**

#### First, download the file:

```bash
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0250EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Bash%20Scripting/top-sites.txt
```

#### ‚úÖ Use `grep` to search for "org":

```bash
grep "org" top-sites.txt
```

This lists all URLs or domains that include "org".

#### üîÑ Alternative solution using case-insensitive match:

```bash
grep -i "org" top-sites.txt
```

Useful if you want to catch both "org" and "ORG", etc.

---

### 4. **Print the first 7 lines of `top-sites.txt`**

#### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
head -7 top-sites.txt
```

This gives a quick preview of the top sites list.

---

### 5. **Print the last 7 lines of `top-sites.txt`**

#### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
tail -7 top-sites.txt
```

Handy when you're interested in newer entries at the end of a list or log file.

---

### 6. **Print the first three characters of each line from `top-sites.txt`**

#### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cut -c -3 top-sites.txt
```

This extracts only the first 3 characters from every line ‚Äî useful for fixed-width data or codes.

---

### 7. **Extract and view only the names from `names_and_numbers.csv`**

Assuming the file already exists:

```bash
cat names_and_numbers.csv
```

#### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cut -d "," -f1 names_and_numbers.csv
```

- `-d ","` tells `cut` to use comma as the delimiter
- `-f1` selects the **first field** ‚Äî which is the name column

You can also skip the header if needed:

```bash
tail -n +2 names_and_numbers.csv | cut -d "," -f1
```

### USER

yes continue

### ASSISTANT

### üöÄ Great! Let's Continue with:

## **Exercise 7 ‚Äì Combining Commands with Pipes and Redirection**

In this exercise, you‚Äôll learn how to:

- Combine multiple Linux commands using **pipes (`|`)**
- Redirect command output to files using `>` and `>>`
- Use input redirection with `<`
- Build powerful **command pipelines** that process data step-by-step

These skills are essential for:

- Automating repetitive tasks
- Processing logs or large datasets
- Writing shell scripts
- Becoming a more efficient Linux user

---

## üîß What is Piping?

The **pipe operator (`|`)** takes the **output of one command** and feeds it as **input to another**.

This lets you chain together small tools to build complex operations.

### Example:

```bash
ls -l | grep "Jan" | wc -l
```

This pipeline:

1. Lists all files (`ls -l`)
2. Filters only those modified in January (`grep "Jan"`)
3. Counts them (`wc -l`)

---

## üì• Input and Output Redirection

You can also control where input comes from and where output goes using:

| Operator | Purpose                                | Example                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `>`      | Redirect output to a file (overwrites) | `ls > files.txt`               |
| `>>`     | Append output to a file                | `echo "New line" >> files.txt` |
| `<`      | Redirect input from a file             | `sort < names.txt`             |

### Example:

```bash
grep "error" /var/log/syslog > errors.txt
```

Saves all lines containing "error" from the system log into a new file.

---

## üí° Hands-On Practice

Let‚Äôs go through some guided examples.

### ‚úÖ 1. Chain `grep`, `sort`, and `uniq` to Analyze Log Data

#### Find unique IP addresses in an access log:

```bash
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $9}' | sort | uniq
```

- `grep`: filters for failed login attempts
- `awk`: extracts the IP address field
- `sort`: prepares for deduplication
- `uniq`: removes duplicates

> You'll learn about `awk` soon ‚Äî it's a powerful text processing tool.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Save Command Output to a File

#### Save your list of running processes to a file:

```bash
ps -e > process_list.txt
```

Now view it:

```bash
cat process_list.txt
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Count Words in a File Using a Pipeline

#### Count how many times each word appears in `usdoi.txt`:

```bash
tr ' ' '\n' < usdoi.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

What this does:

- `tr ' ' '\n'`: replaces spaces with newlines (puts each word on its own line)
- `sort`: sorts words alphabetically
- `uniq -c`: counts occurrences
- `sort -nr`: sorts numerically in reverse order

---

### ‚úÖ 4. View Command Output One Page at a Time

Sometimes output fills your screen. Use `less` to page through it:

```bash
history | less
```

Use ‚Üë ‚Üì keys to scroll, and press `q` to quit.

---

## üìã Summary Table: Pipes & Redirection

| Task                           | Command               |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------- | --------- |
| Pipe output to another command | `command1             | command2` |
| Redirect output to a file      | `command > file.txt`  |
| Append output to a file        | `command >> file.txt` |
| Read input from a file         | `command < file.txt`  |

---

## üß† Why This Matters

With pipes and redirection, you can:

- **Automate workflows** with simple, reusable components
- **Process large amounts of data** efficiently
- **Build custom scripts** that do exactly what you need

A Brief Introduction to Networking
Here we introduce some key concepts related to computer networking. This is an optional but recommended reading which is designed to help you build context for what you will be learning later about networking and informational commands.

Learning Objectives
After completing this reading, you will be able to:

Describe computer networks, network resources, and network nodes
Explain hosts, clients, and servers
Describe packets and pings
Explain URLs and IP addresses
Computer Networks
A computer network is a set of computers that are able to communicate with each other and share resources provided by network nodes.

Examples of computer networks include Local Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Networks (WANs), and the entire Internet. The Internet, or World Wide Web, is essentially a giant network of computer networks.

A network resource is any object, such as a file or document, which can be identified by the network.

An object is identifiable if it can be assigned a unique name and address that the network can use to identify and access it.

A network node is any device that participates in a network.

A network can include any device which is not necessarily a computer but is part of the network‚Äôs infrastructure. Examples of network nodes include modems, network switches, hubs, and wifi hotspots.

Hosts, Clients, and Servers
A host is a special type of node in a computer network - it is a computer that can function as a server or a client on a network.

A server is a host computer that is able to accept a connection from a client host and fulfill certain resource requests made by the client.

Many hosts can perform either role, acting as both client and server.

Packets and Pings
A network packet is a formatted chunk of data that can be transmitted over a network.

Today's computer networks typically use communication protocols that are based on such packets of information. Every packet consists of two types of data: 1. the control information, and 2. the payload. The control information is data about how and where to deliver the payload, such as the source and destination network addresses, while the payload is the message being sent.

The ping command works by sending special 'echo request' packets to a host and waiting for a response from the host.

ping is a utility available on most operating systems that have networking capability. Linux has its own implementation of the ping command that's used to test and troubleshoot connectivity to other network hosts.

URLs and IP Adresses
IP stands for "Internet Protocol" which defines the format of data transmitted over the internet or a local network.

An IP address is a code used to uniquely identify any host on a network.

An IP address can be used to establish a connection to a host and exchange packets with it, for example using the ping command. In addition to their payload, IP packets - a type of network packet that conforms to the Internet Protocol - contain the IP addresses of the source and destination hosts.

A URL, more commonly known as a web address, stands for Uniform Resource Locator.

A URL uniquely identifies a web resource and enables access to that resource. Typically the resource that a URL points to is a web page, but it can also be used for tasks such as transferring files, sending emails, and accessing databases.

For example, the URL to the Wikipedia page for URL is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL. Just like for a typical URL, its format indicates a protocol (https), a hostname (en.wikipedia.org), and a file name (/wiki/URL).

Summary
In this reading, you learned that:

A computer network is a set of computers that are able to communicate with each other and share resources. A network resource is any object, such as a file or document, which can be identified by the network. A network node is any device that participates in a network.
A host is a computer that can function as a server or a client on a network. A server is a host computer that is able to accept a connection from a client host and fulfill certain resource requests made by the client.
A network packet is a formatted chunk of data that can be transmitted over a network. The ping command works by sending special 'echo request' packets to a host and waiting for a response from the host.
An IP address is a code used to uniquely identify any host on a network. A URL identifies a web resource and enables access to that resource.

- A **computer network** is a collection of interconnected devices that can communicate and share resources.
- Examples:
  - **LAN (Local Area Network)** ‚Äì small, localized network (e.g., home or office)
  - **WAN (Wide Area Network)** ‚Äì covers large geographical areas (e.g., the internet)
  - **The Internet** ‚Äì a global network of networks

> üí° The internet is essentially a **network of computer networks**.

---

### üîÅ Hosts, Clients, and Servers

| Term       | Description                                                                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Host**   | Any device on a network with an IP address. Can act as a **server** or **client** |
| **Client** | Requests services or data from a server                                           |
| **Server** | Provides services or data to clients (e.g., web servers, email servers)           |

> üí° Many devices can switch roles ‚Äî acting as both client and server when needed.

---

### üì¶ Packets and Pings

#### What Is a Network Packet?

- A packet is a **formatted unit of data** sent over a network.
- Contains:
  - **Control information**: source, destination, routing info
  - **Payload**: actual data being transmitted

#### What Is `ping`?

- A utility used to test connectivity between two hosts
- Works by sending an **"echo request"** packet and waiting for a response
- Helps diagnose connection issues (e.g., "Can I reach Google's servers?")

Example command:

```bash
ping google.com
```

---

### üåç URLs and IP Addresses

#### What Is an IP Address?

- Stands for **Internet Protocol Address**
- A unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network
- Used to **locate and communicate** with other devices
- Example IPv4 address: `192.168.1.1`
- Example IPv6 address: `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`

> üí° When you use `ping`, it uses **IP addresses** to send and receive packets.

---

#### What Is a URL?

- Stands for **Uniform Resource Locator**
- Also known as a **web address**
- Identifies the location of a resource on the internet and how to access it

#### URL Format:

```
protocol://hostname/path
```

Example:

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL
```

Breakdown:

- **Protocol**: `https` ‚Äì method to retrieve the resource
- **Hostname**: `en.wikipedia.org` ‚Äì server where the resource lives
- **Path**: `/wiki/URL` ‚Äì specific file/resource on the server

> üìå URLs make it easier for humans to access resources without needing to remember complex IP addresses.

| Show info about a specific interface (e.g., eth0) | `ip addr show eth0` |

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 1.1 Display Your System‚Äôs Hostname and IP Address

#### View the current **hostname**:

```bash
hostname
```

Example output:

```
theia-2c65847f
```

The **hostname** helps identify your machine on a network ‚Äî especially useful in server environments.

#### View the system's **IP address**:

```bash
hostname -i
```

Example output:

```
172.17.0.2
```

> üí° This shows the **IPv4 address** associated with your host.

---

### üîπ 1.2 Display Network Interface Configuration

Before running the `ip` command, you installed the `iproute2` package:

#### Update and install:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install iproute2
```

Now you can use the powerful `ip` command.

#### Show all network interfaces:

```bash
ip a
```

or

```bash
ip addr
```

This displays information like:

- Interface name (`lo`, `eth0`, etc.)
- IP addresses (`inet`, `inet6`)
- MAC address (`link/ether`)
- Status (`UP`, `DOWN`)

Example output line:

```
inet 172.17.0.2/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global eth0
```

Here, `172.17.0.2` is your **IPv4 address**.

#### Show configuration for a specific interface (like `eth0`):

```bash
ip addr show eth0
```

> üìå `eth0` is typically the **primary Ethernet interface** used to connect to the network.

You'll see:

- The device status (`UP`)
- Its IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
- Broadcast and subnet mask info

# üß™ Exercise 2 ‚Äì Test Network Connectivity with `ping`

In this exercise, you learned how to use the **`ping`** command to test whether your system can successfully communicate with another device or website over the network.

This is a fundamental tool for:

- Checking internet connectivity
- Diagnosing network issues
- Testing server availability

---

## üîç Overview of What You Learned

| Task                                   | Command                    |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Ping a host continuously               | `ping www.google.com`      |
| Ping a host a specific number of times | `ping -c 5 www.google.com` |

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 2.1 Test Connectivity to a Host Using `ping`

#### Ping Google continuously:

```bash
ping www.google.com
```

You‚Äôll see output like:

```
64 bytes from 142.251.42.78: icmp_seq=1 ttl=115 time=15.3 ms
64 bytes from 142.251.42.78: icmp_seq=2 ttl=115 time=14.9 ms
...
```

Each line shows:

- The size of the response
- The IP address of the responding server
- Sequence number
- Time-to-live (TTL)
- Round-trip time in milliseconds

> ‚ö†Ô∏è To stop the ping process, press **Ctrl + C**

---

#### Ping a Host a Specific Number of Times

To limit the number of packets sent, use the `-c` option:

```bash
ping -c 5 www.google.com
```

This sends **exactly 5 packets**, then stops automatically.

Useful for:

- Scripting and automation
- Quick tests without manually stopping the command

## üìã Summary Table

| Command                | Description                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `ping hostname`        | Tests if a remote host is reachable     |
| `ping -c N hostname`   | Pings the host exactly N times          |
| `ping -c 5 google.com` | Sends 5 packets to google.com and stops |

---

## üß† Why This Matters

Using `ping` helps you quickly determine:

- Whether you have **internet access**
- If a **remote server is online**
- How fast your connection is (based on **response time**)
- If there‚Äôs packet loss or high latency

It's one of the most basic yet powerful tools in any Linux user's networking toolkit.

Exercise 3 - View or download data from a server
3.1. Transfer data from a server
curl

You can use curl to access the file at the following URL and display the file's contents on your screen:

1
curl https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0250EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Bash%20Scripting/usdoi.txt

Copied!
To access the file at the given URL and also save it in your current working directory, use the -O option:

1
curl -O https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0250EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Bash%20Scripting/usdoi.txt

Copied!
You can also use curl to view the HTML code for any web page if you know its URL.

3.2. Download file(s) from a URL
wget

The wget command is similar to curl, however its primary use is for file downloading. One unique feature of wget is that it can recursively download files at a URL.

To see wget in action, first remove usdoi.txt from your current directory:

1
rm usdoi.txt

Copied!
then download it again using wget as follows:

1
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0250EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Bash%20Scripting/usdoi.txt

# üöÄ Let's Continue with:

## **Exercise 4 ‚Äì Exploring DNS and Looking Up Domain Information**

In this exercise, you'll learn how to:

- Understand what **DNS** is and why it matters
- Use `nslookup` and `dig` to look up domain information
- Check **IP addresses**, **name servers**, and **mail servers** associated with a domain

These tools are essential for:

- Troubleshooting domain issues
- Checking website availability
- Understanding how domains resolve to IP addresses
- Debugging email delivery problems using MX records

---

## üåê What Is DNS?

**DNS (Domain Name System)** is like the phonebook of the internet.

It maps **human-readable domain names** (like `google.com`) to **machine-readable IP addresses** (like `172.217.174.78`), so your computer knows where to find a website or service.

### Key DNS Concepts:

| Term            | Meaning                                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **A Record**    | Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address              |
| **AAAA Record** | Maps a domain to an IPv6 address                   |
| **CNAME**       | Alias record pointing one domain to another        |
| **MX Record**   | Specifies mail servers for a domain                |
| **NS Record**   | Identifies authoritative name servers for a domain |

---

## üîç Step-by-Step: Using `nslookup`

The `nslookup` command helps you query DNS servers to get domain-related information.

### ‚úÖ View Basic DNS Info for a Website

```bash
nslookup google.com
```

This shows:

- The **IP address** of the domain
- The **DNS server** used to retrieve the info

---

### ‚úÖ Look Up Mail Servers (MX Records)

```bash
nslookup -type=mx gmail.com
```

This lists the **mail exchange (MX) servers** responsible for receiving emails for `gmail.com`.

---

### ‚úÖ Query Name Servers (NS Records)

```bash
nslookup -type=ns ibm.com
```

This shows which **name servers** are responsible for managing the domain‚Äôs DNS records.

---

## üîé Step-by-Step: Using `dig`

`dig` (**Domain Information Groper**) is a more detailed and powerful tool than `nslookup`. It gives you full control over DNS queries.

### ‚úÖ View A Record for a Domain

```bash
dig google.com
```

Look for the **ANSWER SECTION**:

```
google.com.     299     IN      A       172.217.174.78
```

This shows the **IPv4 address** that `google.com` resolves to.

---

### ‚úÖ Look Up MX Records with `dig`

```bash
dig MX gmail.com
```

Scroll down to the **ANSWER SECTION** to see which servers handle email for Gmail.

---

### ‚úÖ Get All DNS Records for a Domain

```bash
dig ANY ibm.com
```

This fetches all available DNS records for `ibm.com`, including:

- A / AAAA
- CNAME
- MX
- NS
- TXT (used for SPF, DKIM, etc.)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Some domains may restrict "ANY" queries for security reasons.

| Task                           | Command                       |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| View basic DNS info            | `nslookup google.com`         |
| Look up MX records (for email) | `nslookup -type=mx gmail.com` |
| Look up name servers           | `nslookup -type=ns ibm.com`   |
| View A record                  | `dig google.com`              |
| View MX records                | `dig MX gmail.com`            |
| View all DNS records           | `dig ANY ibm.com`             |

---

## üß† Why This Matters

Understanding DNS helps you:

- Diagnose **domain resolution issues**
- Verify **email server settings**
- Configure **custom domains**
- Troubleshoot **website downtime**

Tools like `nslookup` and `dig` are invaluable for system administrators, developers, and anyone working with web services.

# üì¶ Exercise 1 - File and Folder Archiving and Compression

In this exercise, you learned how to **package**, **compress**, and **extract** files using the Linux command line tools:

- `tar` ‚Äì for creating `.tar` archives
- `zip` ‚Äì for compressing into `.zip` format
- `unzip` ‚Äì for extracting `.zip` files

These are essential skills for:

- Backing up data
- Transferring multiple files as a single package
- Saving disk space with compression
- Managing software distributions or logs

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 1.1 Create and Manage File Archives with `tar`

#### Create a `.tar` archive of the `/bin` directory:

```bash
tar -cvf bin.tar /bin
```

- `-c` = create a new archive
- `-v` = show progress (verbose)
- `-f` = specify filename (`bin.tar`)

This creates a large file called `bin.tar`, which contains all files from the `/bin` directory.

---

#### List contents of the `.tar` archive:

```bash
tar -tvf bin.tar
```

This shows a detailed list of files inside the archive ‚Äî useful for verifying contents before extraction.

---

#### Extract files from the `.tar` archive:

```bash
tar -xvf bin.tar
```

- `-x` = extract
- `-v` = show progress
- `-f` = specify filename

After extraction, you'll see a folder named `bin` in your current directory.

> Tip: Use `ls -l` to confirm it was extracted correctly.

---

### üîπ 1.2 Package and Compress Archive Files with `zip`

#### Create a `.zip` file of all `.conf` files in `/etc`:

```bash
zip config.zip /etc/*.conf
```

This bundles all configuration files ending in `.conf` into one compressed file: `config.zip`.

---

#### Create a compressed ZIP archive of an entire directory:

```bash
zip -ry bin.zip /bin
```

- `-r` = recursively include all files and subdirectories
- `-y` = store symbolic links as such (instead of following them)

This compresses the entire `/bin` directory into a portable `bin.zip` file.

---

### üîπ 1.3 Extract, List, or Test ZIP Archives with `unzip`

#### List contents of a `.zip` file:

```bash
unzip -l config.zip
```

This shows what‚Äôs inside the archive without extracting anything ‚Äî helpful for previewing.

---

#### Extract all files from a `.zip` archive:

```bash
unzip -o bin.zip
```

- `-o` = overwrite existing files (useful if you run the command more than once)
- Automatically creates a `bin` directory containing the extracted files

---

## üìã Summary Table

| Task                 | Command                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Create tar archive   | `tar -cvf archive.tar directory/` |
| List tar contents    | `tar -tvf archive.tar`            |
| Extract tar archive  | `tar -xvf archive.tar`            |
| Zip specific files   | `zip archive.zip file1 file2`     |
| Zip entire directory | `zip -r archive.zip directory/`   |
| List zip contents    | `unzip -l archive.zip`            |
| Extract zip archive  | `unzip -o archive.zip`            |

---

## üß† Why This Matters

Understanding archiving and compression helps you:

- Bundle and share multiple files easily
- Save storage space
- Backup important directories
- Transfer data securely between systems

`tar` is commonly used in Linux environments for packaging, while `zip` offers cross-platform compatibility with Windows and macOS.

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Combine `tar` and `gzip` for compressed archives:
  ```bash
  tar -czvf archive.tar.gz directory/
  ```
- Use wildcards with zip:
  ```bash
  zip logfiles.zip *.log

### USER

Module Summary & Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that:

A shell is an interactive user interface. You use shell commands to navigate and work with files and directories.

The `curl` and `wget` commands display and download files from URLs, and the`cat` and `tail`commands display file contents.

You can get user information with the `whoami` and `id`commands, and get operating system information using the `uname` command. You can check system disk usage using the `df` command and monitor processes and resource usage with `ps` and `top`.Print string or variable value using `echo`,print and extract information about the date with the `date` command, and read the manual for any command using `man`.

`ls` lists all files and directories within a specified directory tree and `cd` navigates between directories. The `find` command finds files in your directories.

Relative paths are relative to your current working directory, while absolute paths stand independently

You can create files and directories with the `touch` and `mkdir` commands, delete them with `rm` and `rmdir`, and copy and move them `cp` and `mv`.

The `cat`, `more`, `head`, and `tail` commands allow you to sort and view file contents or view only a certain number of lines. Determine line, word, and character counts with `wc`.

You can use `sort` to view the lines of a file alphanumerically and `uniq` to remove repeated lines from your view. `grep` gets the lines of a file that match your desired criteria, and `cut` extracts slices and fields from lines. You can merge lines from different files using `paste`.

`hostname` and `ip` allow you to view the network configuration. You can test a network connection using `ping` and send and receive data using `curl` and `wget`.

Compression preserves storage space, speeds data transfer, and reduces system load.

`zip` compresses files and folders prior to archiving them. `tar` archives and compresses files and directories into a tarball. `unzip` unpacks and decompresses a zipped archive, and `tar` can also decompress and unpack a tar.gz archive.

Reading: A Brief Introduction to Shell Variables
Learning Objectives
After completing this reading, you will be able to:

Describe shell variables
Create shell variables
What is a shell variable?
Shell variables offer a powerful way to store and later access or modify information such as numbers, character strings, and other data structures by name. Let's look at some basic examples to get the idea.

Consider the following example.

1
2
3
$ firstname=Jeff
$ echo $firstname
Jeff

Copied!
The first line assigns the value Jeff to a new variable called firstname. The next line accesses and displays the value of the variable, using the echo command along with the special character $ in front of the variable name to extract its value, which is the string Jeff.

Thus, we have created a new shell variable called firstname for which the value is Jeff.

This is the most basic way to create a shell variable and assign it to a value all in one step.

Reading user input into a shell variable at the command line
Here's another way to create a shell variable, using the read command.
After entering

1
$ read lastname

Copied!
on the command line, the shell waits for you to enter some text:

1
2
3
$ read lastname  
Grossman  
$

Copied!
Now we can see that the value Grossman has just been stored in the variable lastname by the read command:

1
2
3
4
$ read lastname  
Grossman  
$ echo $lastname  
Grossman

Copied!
By the way, notice that you can echo the values of multiple variables at once.

1
2
$ echo $firstname $lastname  
Jeff Grossman

Copied!
As you will soon see, the read command is particularly useful in shell scripting. You can use it within a shell script to prompt users to input information, which is then stored in a shell variable and available for use by the shell script while it is running. You will also learn about command line arguments, which are values that can be passed to a script and automatically assigned to shell variables.

Summary
In this reading, you learned that:

Shell variables store values and allow users to later access them by name
You can create shell variables by declaring a shell variable and value or by using the read command

### ASSISTANT

# üßæ **Reading: A Brief Introduction to Shell Variables**

In this reading, you were introduced to one of the most powerful and essential features in shell scripting ‚Äî **shell variables**. These allow you to store and manipulate data directly in the terminal or within scripts.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives Recap

After completing this reading, you can now:

‚úÖ **Describe what shell variables are**  
‚úÖ **Create and use your own shell variables**  
‚úÖ **Read user input into a variable using `read`**

---

## üí° What Is a Shell Variable?

A **shell variable** is a named storage location that holds a value ‚Äî such as a string, number, or command output ‚Äî for use in the shell environment.

### üîπ Example:

```bash
firstname=Jeff
echo $firstname
```

Output:

```
Jeff
```

- `firstname=Jeff` ‚Üí Assigns the value `Jeff` to the variable `firstname`
- `$firstname` ‚Üí Retrieves (expands) the value stored in the variable

> ‚ö†Ô∏è No spaces around the `=` when assigning values:
>
> ```bash
> # Correct
> name=Linux
>
> # Incorrect
> name = Linux  ‚ùå
> ```

---

## üß© Creating Shell Variables

### üîπ Direct Assignment

You can create a variable by simply giving it a name and assigning a value:

```bash
greeting="Hello World"
echo $greeting
```

Output:

```
Hello World
```

Quotes help preserve whitespace and special characters.

---

### üîπ Reading User Input with `read`

The `read` command lets you capture input from the user and store it in a variable.

#### Example:

```bash
read lastname
Grossman
echo $lastname
```

Output:

```
Grossman
```

This is especially useful in **scripts**, where you want to interactively gather information from users.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Combining Variables

You can combine multiple variables in one command:

```bash
echo $firstname $lastname
```

Output:

```
Jeff Grossman
```

This makes it easy to build dynamic messages or paths based on user input or system state.

| Task                            | Command          |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Create a variable               | `var_name=value` |
| Access variable value           | `$var_name`      |
| Read user input into a variable | `read var_name`  |
| Print variable content          | `echo $var_name` |

---

## üß† Why Shell Variables Matter

Shell variables are essential because they allow you to:

- **Store temporary data** during a session
- **Make scripts interactive** with user input
- **Customize behavior** of shell scripts
- **Reuse values** without hardcoding them

They're the foundation of automation in Bash scripting!

### USER

Exercise 1 - Create and execute a basic shell script
In this exercise, you will create a simple script which will do the following:

Accept a user name
Print a welcome message to the user
You will also add comments to the script, which are lines starting with #. Comments are not executed by the shell.

When used appropriately, comments can make a shell script more readable and help in debugging the script.

1.1. Create a new script file
Step 1: On the menu on the lab screen, use File->New File to create a new file.

File menu highlights New File!

Step 2: Name it as greet.sh and click OK

New file name entered and OK button is highlighted

Step 3: Copy and paste the following lines into the newly created file.

# This script accepts the user\'s name and prints

# a message greeting the user

# Print the prompt message on screen

echo -n "Enter your name :"

# Wait for user to enter a name, and save the entered name into the variable \'name\'

read name

# Print the welcome message followed by the name

echo "Welcome $name"

# The following message should print on a single line. Hence the usage of \'-n\'

echo -n "Congratulations! You just created and ran your first shell script "
echo "using Bash on IBM Skills Network"

Copied!
Step 4: Save the file using the File->Save menu option.

1.2. Execute the script
Open a new terminal by clicking on the menu bar and selecting Terminal->New Terminal, as in the image below.

Terminal menu points to New Terminal

This will open a new terminal at the bottom of the screen.

Terminal screen points to New terminal at lower portion of screen

Run the commands below in the newly opened terminal.

Let's check the permissions for this new file by entering the following:

1
ls -l greet.sh

Copied!
If the file exists and has read permissions, run the following command to execute it:

1
bash greet.sh

Copied!
The message Enter your name : appears on screen.

Type your name and press the Enter key.

You should now see the welcome messages displayed on screen with your entered name.

Welcome message with your name and congratulations message

Congratulations! You have succesfully executed your first Bash shell script.

### ASSISTANT

# üìú Exercise 1 ‚Äì Create and Execute a Basic Shell Script

In this hands-on exercise, you created your **first Bash shell script** called `greet.sh`. You used:

- **Shell variables** to store user input
- The `echo` command to print messages
- **Comments** (`#`) to document the script
- The `read` command to accept input from the user

You then executed it using `bash greet.sh`.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 1.1 Create a New Script File

#### Steps:

1. Opened a new file in the editor (via `File > New File`)
2. Saved it as: `greet.sh`
3. Pasted the following Bash script:

```bash
# This script accepts the user's name and prints
# a message greeting the user

# Print the prompt message on screen
echo -n "Enter your name :"

# Wait for user to enter a name, and save the entered name into the variable 'name'
read name

# Print the welcome message followed by the name
echo "Welcome $name"

# The following message should print on a single line. Hence the usage of '-n'
echo -n "Congratulations! You just created and ran your first shell script "
echo "using Bash on IBM Skills Network"
```

> üí° Tip: The `-n` option in `echo` prevents the automatic newline ‚Äî useful when printing across multiple lines.

4. Saved the file using `File > Save`

---

### üîπ 1.2 Execute the Script

#### Step 1: Open a Terminal

- Clicked `Terminal > New Terminal` to open a terminal window

#### Step 2: Check File Permissions

```bash
ls -l greet.sh
```

Make sure it exists and is readable.

#### Step 3: Run the script

```bash
bash greet.sh
```

#### What Happens:

- It prompts:
  ```
  Enter your name :
  ```
- You type your name and press **Enter**
- It responds with:
  ```
  Welcome [YourName]
  Congratulations! You just created and ran your first shell script using Bash on IBM Skills Network
  ```

‚úÖ Success! You've run your **first Bash script**.

## üß† Why This Matters

This simple script introduces several key scripting concepts:

| Feature                | Purpose                                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `#`                    | Adds comments to explain what the script does   |
| `echo`                 | Prints text or variables to the terminal        |
| `read`                 | Captures user input and stores it in a variable |
| Variables like `$name` | Store dynamic values for later use              |
| Multiple `echo` lines  | Control how output appears on screen            |

These are the building blocks of **Bash scripting**, which powers automation in Linux environments.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Scripting Tips

- Make scripts executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x greet.sh
  ./greet.sh
  ```
- Always test your scripts before sharing them
- Use comments to help others understand your code
- Use descriptive variable names like `username`, not `x`

---

### USER

Exercise 2 - Using a shebang line
In this exercise, you will edit the greet.sh script you created in the previous exercise by adding a 'shebang' and making it an executable file.

This is done to ensure that the name of the script can be used like a command. Adding this special shebang line lets you specify the path to the interpreter of the script - in this case, the Bash shell.

Follow the steps below to learn how to add a shebang to your script.

2.1. Find the path to the interpreter
The which command helps you find out the path of the command bash.

1
which bash

Copied!
In this case, it returns the path /bin/bash.

2.2. Edit the script greet.sh and add the shebang line to the script
Open the file and add the following line at the beginning of the script:

1
#! /bin/bash

Copied!
The script should now look like the following:

Script with the shebang line that you added

2.3. Check the permissions of the script
One more step needs to be completed to make greet.sh completely executable by name.

To add the execute permission for the user on greet.sh, enter the following:

1
chmod +x greet.sh

Copied!
Verify whether the execute permission is granted.

Tip: Generally it's not a good idea to grant permissions to a script for all users, groups, and others. It's more appropriate to limit the execute permission to only the owner, or the user who created the file (you).

To change permissions for greet.sh to make the file executable for the user, run the command below:

1
chmod u+x greet.sh

Copied!
Verify the permissions using the command below:

1
ls -l greet.sh

Copied!
If you wish to grant execute permission to everyone, you need to run the command chmod +x greet.sh.

2.4. Execute the script.
Enter the command given below to run the shell script.

1
./greet.sh

Copied!
The . here refers to the current directory. You are telling Linux to execute the script greet.sh and that it can be found in the current directory.

### ASSISTANT

# üîß Exercise 2 ‚Äì Using a Shebang Line

In this exercise, you took your **first Bash script (`greet.sh`)** to the next level by:

- Adding a **shebang line** (`#!`) to specify the interpreter
- Making it **executable**, so you can run it like a regular command: `./greet.sh`

This is a foundational step toward writing **portable and reusable shell scripts**.

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 2.1 Find the Path to the Bash Interpreter

You used the `which` command to locate where `bash` is installed:

```bash
which bash
```

Output:

```
/bin/bash
```

This tells you that the Bash shell is located at `/bin/bash`.

---

### üîπ 2.2 Add the Shebang Line to Your Script

You opened `greet.sh` and added the shebang line at the very top:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

This line tells the system:

> "Use `/bin/bash` to interpret this script."

Your updated script now looks like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This script accepts the user's name and prints
# a message greeting the user

echo -n "Enter your name :"
read name
echo "Welcome $name"
echo -n "Congratulations! You just created and ran your first shell script "
echo "using Bash on IBM Skills Network"
```

‚úÖ This makes your script self-contained and portable ‚Äî any system with Bash can now execute it.

---

### üîπ 2.3 Make the Script Executable

#### First, check current permissions:

```bash
ls -l greet.sh
```

It likely looked like:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 200 Apr 5 10:00 greet.sh
```

No execute permission yet!

#### Add execute permission for the owner:

```bash
chmod u+x greet.sh
```

Or make it executable for everyone:

```bash
chmod +x greet.sh
```

#### Verify the new permissions:

```bash
ls -l greet.sh
```

Now it should show:

```
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user group 200 Apr 5 10:00 greet.sh
```

The `x` means the file is now **executable**.

---

### üîπ 2.4 Run the Script Like a Command

You executed your script using:

```bash
./greet.sh
```

- `./` tells the shell to look in the **current directory**
- `greet.sh` is your **self-executable script**

You were prompted:

```
Enter your name :
```

After entering your name, you saw:

```
Welcome [YourName]
Congratulations! You just created and ran your first shell script using Bash on IBM Skills Network
```

‚úÖ Congratulations again ‚Äî you've successfully made your script **runnable as a command**!

## üìå Summary Table

| Task                            | Command                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Locate Bash interpreter         | `which bash`                     |
| Add shebang line                | `#!/bin/bash` (at top of script) |
| Make script executable for user | `chmod u+x greet.sh`             |
| Make executable for all users   | `chmod +x greet.sh`              |
| Check file permissions          | `ls -l greet.sh`                 |
| Run the script                  | `./greet.sh`                     |

---

## üß† Why This Matters

By adding the **shebang line** and making the script **executable**, you‚Äôve learned how to:

- Turn a text file into a real **Linux command**
- Define which interpreter should run the script
- Improve **script portability** across systems
- Control **who can run** the script via permissions

These are essential steps in creating **custom automation tools** in Linux.

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Always test scripts with:
  ```bash
  bash greet.sh
  ```
  Before making them executable ‚Äî helps catch syntax errors early.
- Use descriptive names for your scripts
- Keep your scripts in a dedicated folder like `~/scripts/` and add it to your `PATH` later
- Use comments liberally to explain what your script does

Examples of Pipes
Learning Objectives
After completing this reading, you will be able to:

Describe pipes
Use pipes to combine commands when working with strings and text file contents
Use pipes to extract information from URLs
What are pipes?
Put simply, pipes are commands in Linux which allow you to use the output of one command as the input of another.

Pipes | use the following format:

1
[command 1] | [command 2] | [command 3] ... | [command n]

Copied!
There is no limit to the number of times you can chain pipes in a row!

In this lab, you'll take a closer look at how you can use pipes and filters to solve basic data processing problems.

Pipe examples
Combining commands
Let's start with a commonly used example. Recall the following commands:

sort - sorts the lines of text in a file and displays the result
uniq - prints a text file with any consecutive, repeated lines collapsed to a single line
With the help of the pipe operator, you can combine these commands to print all the unique lines in a file.

Suppose you have the file pets.txt with the following contents:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
$ cat pets.txt
goldfish
dog
cat
parrot
dog
goldfish
goldfish

Copied!
If you only use sort on pets.txt, you get:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
$ sort pets.txt
cat
dog
dog
goldfish
goldfish
goldfish
parrot

Copied!
The file is sorted, but there are duplicated lines of "dog" and "goldfish".

On the other hand, if you only use uniq, you get:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
$ uniq pets.txt
goldfish
dog
cat
parrot
dog
goldfish

Copied!
This time, you removed consecutive duplicates, but non-consecutive duplicates of "dog" and "goldfish" remain.

But by combining the two commands in the correct order - by first using sort then uniq - you get back:

1
2
3
4
5
$ sort pets.txt | uniq
cat
dog
goldfish
parrot

Copied!
Since sort sorts all identical items consecutively, and uniq removes all consecutive duplicates, combining the commands prints only the unique lines from pets.txt!

Applying a command to strings and files
Some commands such as tr only accept standard input - normally text entered from your keyboard - but not strings or filenames.

tr (translate) - replaces characters in input text
1
tr [OPTIONS] [target characters] [replacement characters]

Copied!
In cases like this, you can use piping to apply the command to strings and file contents.

With strings, you can use echo in combination with tr to replace all the vowels in a string with underscores \_:

1
2
$ echo "Linux and shell scripting are awesome\!" | tr "aeiou" "_"
L_n_x \_nd sh_ll scr_pt_ng \_r_ _w_s_m_!

Copied!
To perform the complement of the operation from the previous example - or to replace all the consonants (any letter that is not a vowel) with an underscore - you can use the -c option:

1
2
$ echo "Linux and shell scripting are awesome\!" | tr -c "aeiou" "\_"
\_i_u**a\_\_\_**e**\_\_**i**i\_**a*e_a_e_o_e*

Copied!
With files, you can use cat in combination with tr to change all of the text in a file to uppercase as follows:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
$ cat pets.txt | tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]"
GOLDFISH
DOG
CAT
PARROT
DOG
GOLDFISH
GOLDFISH

Copied!
The possibilities are endless! For example, you could add uniq to the above pipeline to only return unique lines in the file, like so:

1
2
3
4
5
$ sort pets.txt | uniq | tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]"
CAT
DOG
GOLDFISH
PARROT

]
}
}

Copied!
Copy the above output in a file and name it as Bitcoinprice.txt.

The JSON field you want to grab here is "price": [numbers].[numbers]". To get this, you can use the following grep command to extract it from the JSON text:

1
grep -oE "\"price\"\s*:\s*[0-9]_\.?[0-9]_"

Copied!
Let's break down the details of this statement:

-o tells grep to only return the matching portion
-E tells grep to be able to use extended regex symbols such as ?
\"price\" matches the string "price"
\s* matches any number (including 0) of whitespace (\s) characters
: matches :
[0-9]* matches any number of digits (from 0 to 9)
\.? optionally matches a .
Use the cat command to get the output of the JSON file and pipe it with the grep command to get the required output.

1
cat Bitcoinprice.txt | grep -oE "\"price\"\s*:\s*[0-9]_\.?[0-9]_"

Copied!
You can also extract information directly from URLs and retreive any specific data using such grep commands.

Summary
In this reading, you learned that:

Pipes are commands in Linux which allow you to use the output of one command as the input of another
You can combine commands such as sort and uniq to organize strings and text file contents
You can pipe the output of a curl command to grep to extract components of URL data

### ASSISTANT

# üîó Examples of Pipes in Linux

Pipes (`|`) are one of the most powerful features in Linux and Bash scripting. They allow you to **connect commands**, using the output of one as input for the next.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives Recap

After this reading, you can now:

‚úÖ Describe what **pipes** are  
‚úÖ Use pipes to combine commands like `sort`, `uniq`, `tr`, etc.  
‚úÖ Apply pipes to extract information from strings and files  
‚úÖ Extract specific data (like Bitcoin price) from JSON or URLs using `grep` and pipes

---

## üîß What Are Pipes?

A **pipe** takes the **output of one command** and feeds it as **input to another**.

### üîÅ Basic Syntax:

```bash
command1 | command2 | command3
```

There's no limit on how many commands you can chain together!

> üí° This is known as a **pipeline** ‚Äî a sequence of processes where the output of each step becomes the input of the next.

---

## üîÑ Pipe Examples: Combining Commands

You used `sort` and `uniq` together to clean up text and remove duplicates.

### Example: Remove all duplicate lines from `pets.txt`

```bash
sort pets.txt | uniq
```

- `sort`: puts identical lines together
- `uniq`: removes consecutive duplicates

Together, they give you a list of **unique animals**:

```
cat
dog
goldfish
parrot
```

---

## üìÑ Applying Commands to Strings and Files

Some tools like `tr` work with **standard input only** ‚Äî so we use pipes to apply them to strings and file contents.

### Replace vowels in a string with `_`:

```bash
echo "Linux and shell scripting are awesome!" | tr "aeiou" "_"
```

Output:

```
L_n_x _nd sh_ll scr_pt_ng _r_ _w_s_m_!
```

### Convert entire file to uppercase:

```bash
cat pets.txt | tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]"
```

### Combine with `sort` and `uniq`:

```bash
sort pets.txt | uniq | tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]"
```

Result:

```
CAT
DOG
GOLDFISH
PARROT
```

---

## ü™£ Extracting Data from JSON Files

You practiced extracting structured data from a JSON file using `grep` and regular expressions.

### Given JSON content in `Bitcoinprice.txt`:

```json
{
  "coin": {
    "price": 57907.78008618953,
    ...
  }
}
```

### Extract the `"price"` field:

```bash
cat Bitcoinprice.txt | grep -oE "\"price\"\s*:\s*[0-9]*\.?[0-9]*"
```

#### Explanation:

- `-o` ‚Üí show only matched part
- `-E` ‚Üí enable extended regex
- `\"price\"` ‚Üí match `"price"`
- `\s*` ‚Üí match any amount of whitespace
- `:` ‚Üí match colon
- `[0-9]*\.?[0-9]*` ‚Üí match numbers with optional decimal point

This gives:

```
"price" : 57907.78008618953
```

## üåê Extracting Info from URLs

You can combine `curl` or `wget` with `grep` to extract live data from web APIs or pages.

### Example: Get current Bitcoin price from an API:

```bash
curl -s https://api.coinstats.app/public/v1/coins/bitcoin | grep -oE "\"price\": *[0-9]+\.?[0-9]*"
```

Or if you have the JSON saved locally:

```bash
cat Bitcoinprice.txt | grep -oE "\"price\": *[0-9]+\.?[0-9]*"
```

Examples of Bash Shell Features
Learning Objectives
After completing this reading, you will be able to:

List examples of metacharacters
Use quoting to specify literal or special character meanings
Implement input and output redirection
Apply command substitution
Describe applications for command line arguments
Metacharacters
Metacharacters are characters having special meaning that the shell interprets as instructions.

Metacharacter Meaning

# Precedes a comment

; Command separator

- Filename expansion wildcard
  ? Single character wildcard in filename expansion
  Pound #
  The pound # metacharacter is used to represent comments in shell scripts or configuration files. Any text that appears after a # on a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by the shell.

1
2
3
4
#!/bin/bash

# This is a comment

echo "Hello, world!" # This is another comment

Copied!
Comments are useful for documenting your code or configuration files, providing context, and explaining the purpose of the code to other developers who may read it. It's a best practice to include comments in your code or configuration files wherever necessary to make them more readable and maintainable.

Semicolon ;
The semicolon ; metacharacter is used to separate multiple commands on a single command line. When multiple commands are separated by a semicolon, they are executed sequentially in the order they appear on the command line.

1
2
3
$ echo "Hello, "; echo "world!"
Hello,
world!

Copied!
As you can see from the example above, the output of each echo command is printed on separate lines and follows the same sequence in which the commands were specified.

The semicolon metacharacter is useful when you need to run multiple commands sequentially on a single command line.

Asterisk _
The asterisk _ metacharacter is used as a wildcard character to represent any sequence of characters, including none.

1
ls \*.txt

Copied!
In this example, \*.txt is a wildcard pattern that matches any file in the current directory with a .txt extension. The ls command lists the names of all matching files.

Question mark ?
The question mark ? metacharacter is used as a wildcard character to represent any single character.

1
ls file?.txt

Copied!
In this example, file?.txt is a wildcard pattern that matches any file in the current directory with a name starting with file, followed by any single character, and ending with the .txt extension.

Quoting
Quoting is a mechanism that allows you to remove the special meaning of characters, spaces, or other metacharacters in a command argument or shell script. You use quoting when you want the shell to interpret characters literally.

Symbol Meaning
\ Escape metacharacter interpretation
" " Interpret metacharacters within string
' ' Escape all metacharacters within string
Backslash \
The backslash character is used as an escape character. It instructs the shell to preserve the literal interpretation of special characters such as space, tab, and $. For example, if you have a file with spaces in its name, you can use backslashes followed by a space to handle those spaces literally:

1
touch file\ with\ space.txt

Copied!
Double quotes " "
When a string is enclosed in double quotes, most characters are interpreted literally, but metacharacters are interpreted according to their special meaning. For example, you can access variable values using the dollar $ character:

1
2
$ echo "Hello $USER"
Hello <username>

Copied!
Single quotes ' '
When a string is enclosed in single quotes, all characters and metacharacters enclosed within the quotes are interpreted literally. Single quotes alter the above example to produce the following output:

1
2
$ echo 'Hello $USER'
Hello $USER

Copied!
Notice that instead of printing the value of $USER, single quotes cause the terminal to print the string "$USER".

Input/Output redirection
Symbol Meaning

>     Redirect output to file, overwrite
>
> >     Redirect output to file, append
> >
> > 2> Redirect standard error to file, overwrite
> > 2>> Redirect standard error to file, append
> > < Redirect file contents to standard input
> > Input/output (IO) redirection is the process of directing the flow of data between a program and its input/output sources.

By default, a program reads input from standard input, the keyboard, and writes output to standard output, the terminal. However, using IO redirection, you can redirect a program's input or output to or from a file or another program.

Redirect output >
This symbol is used to redirect the standard output of a command to a specified file.

ls > files.txt will create a file called files.txt if it doesn't exist, and write the output of the ls command to it.

Warning: When the file already exists, the output overwrites all of the file's contents!

Redirect and append output >>
This notation is used to redirect and append the output of a command to the end of a file. For example,

ls >> files.txt appends the output of the ls command to the end of file files.txt, and preserves any content that already existed in the file.

Redirect standard output 2>
This notation is used to redirect the standard error output of a command to a file. For example, if you run the ls command on a non-existing directory as follows,

ls non-existent-directory 2> error.txt the shell will create a file called error.txt if it doesn't exist, and redirect the error output of the ls command to the file.

Warning: When the file already exists, the error message overwrites all of the file's contents!

Append standard error 2>>
This symbol redirects the standard error output of a command and appends the error message to the end of a file without overwriting its contents.

ls non-existent-directory 2>> error.txt will append the error output of the ls command to the end of the error.txt file.

Redirect input <
This symbol is used to redirect the standard input of a command from a file or another command. For example,

sort < data.txt will sort the contents of the data.txt file.

Command Substitution
Command substitution allows you to run command and use its output as a component of another command's argument. Command substitution is denoted by enclosing a command in either backticks (`command`) or using the $() syntax. When the encapsulate command is executed, its output is substituted in place, and it can be used as an argument within another command. This is particularly useful for automating tasks that require the use of a command's output as input for another command.

For example, you could store the path to your current directory in a variable by applying command substitution on the pwd command, then move to another directory, and finally return to your original directory by invoking the cd command on the variable you stored, as follows:

1
2
3
$ here=$(pwd)
$ cd path_to_some_other_directory
$ cd $here

Copied!
Command Line Arguments
Command line arguments are additional inputs that can be passed to a program when the program is run from a command line interface. These arguments are specified after the name of the program, and they can be used to modify the behavior of the program, provide input data, or provide output locations. Command line arguments are used to pass arguments to a shell script.

For example, the following command provides two arguments, arg1, and arg2, that can be accessed from within your Bash script:

1
$ ./MyBashScript.sh arg1 arg2

Copied!
Summary
In this reading, you learned that:

Metacharacters such as #, ;, \*, and ? are characters that the shell interprets with special meanings
Quoting allows you to ensure any special characters, spaces, or other metacharacters are interpreted literally by the shell
Input/output redirection redirects a program's input or output to/from a file
Command substitution allows you to use the output of a command as an argument for another command
Command line arguments can be used to pass information to a shell script

### ASSISTANT

# üß† **Examples of Bash Shell Features ‚Äì Summary & Highlights**

In this reading, you explored several powerful features of the **Bash shell**, which are essential for writing clean, effective, and dynamic scripts.

---

## üî§ **Metacharacters in Bash**

These characters have special meanings to the shell and help control how commands behave.

| Metacharacter | Meaning                                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `#`           | Starts a comment (everything after is ignored) |
| `;`           | Separates multiple commands on one line        |
| `*`           | Wildcard matching any number of characters     |
| `?`           | Matches exactly one character                  |

### Examples:

```bash
# This is a comment
echo "Hello"; echo "World"  # Runs both commands
ls *.txt                      # Lists all .txt files
ls file?.txt                  # Matches file1.txt, file2.txt, etc.
```

---

## ‚Äú ‚Äù `' '` `\` **Quoting and Escaping**

Use quoting to control how the shell interprets special characters.

| Symbol | Behavior                                   |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `\`    | Escape single character (e.g., `\$`, `\*`) |
| `" "`  | Allows variable expansion inside string    |
| `' '`  | Treats everything literally ‚Äî no expansion |

### Examples:

```bash
touch file\ with\ space.txt   # Creates a file with spaces in name
echo "Today is $USER"         # Expands variables like $USER
echo 'Today is $USER'         # Prints literal "$USER"
```

---

## üì• **Input/Output Redirection**

You can redirect input (`<`), output (`>` or `>>`), and error streams (`2>`, `2>>`) to or from files.

| Operator | Purpose                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `>`      | Redirect standard output (overwrites file) |
| `>>`     | Append standard output to file             |
| `2>`     | Redirect standard error (overwrites)       |
| `2>>`    | Append standard error                      |
| `<`      | Redirect input from a file                 |

### Examples:

```bash
ls > files.txt          # Saves ls output to files.txt
ls >> files.txt         # Appends more data
grep "error" log.txt > errors.txt  # Saves only matching lines
sort < data.txt         # Sorts content from data.txt
```

---

## üí° **Command Substitution**

Allows you to capture and reuse command outputs as values in your scripts.

### Syntax:

- Backticks: `` `command` `` _(legacy)_
- Preferred: `$(command)` _(modern and nested-friendly)_

### Example:

```bash
here=$(pwd)
cd /tmp
cd $here
```

This lets you store and reuse results dynamically in scripts ‚Äî great for automation!

---

## üìù **Command Line Arguments**

Arguments passed to a script when it‚Äôs executed. You can access them using positional parameters.

### Example:

```bash
./myscript.sh arg1 arg2
```

Inside the script:

```bash
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Second argument: $2"
echo "All arguments: $@"
```

### Positional Parameters:

| Variable        | Description                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `$0`            | Script name                                 |
| `$1`, `$2`, ... | First, second, etc., command-line arguments |
| `$@`            | All arguments as list                       |
| `$#`            | Number of arguments                         |
| `$$`            | PID (Process ID) of the script              |
| `$?`            | Exit status of last command                 |

---

## üîÑ Why These Bash Features Matter

| Feature                  | Use Case                                                        |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Metacharacters**       | Pattern matching, scripting logic                               |
| **Quoting/Escaping**     | Handling filenames, strings with spaces, and special characters |
| **Redirection**          | Logging, filtering, saving output                               |
| **Command substitution** | Dynamic values, reusable scripts                                |
| **Command line args**    | Flexible scripts that behave differently based on inputs        |

---

## ‚úÖ Real-World Examples

### 1. Save and restore directory:

```bash
current_dir=$(pwd)
cd /tmp
cd "$current_dir"
```

### 2. Log output and errors separately:

```bash
my_script.sh > output.log 2> error.log
```

### 3. Pass and use arguments in a script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script name: $0"
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Number of arguments: $#"
```

Run it:

```bash
chmod +x myscript.sh
./myscript.sh Hello World!
```

Output:

```
Script name: ./myscript.sh
First argument: Hello
Number of arguments: 2
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices

- Always quote variables to avoid word splitting:
  ```bash
  echo "$USER"
  ```
- Use `$(...)` over backticks for better readability and nesting
- Use `>` carefully ‚Äî it **overwrites** by default
- Use `>>` to **append** instead
- Include comments using `#` for clarity and documentation

---

echo "Please re-run the script to try again."
fi

### ASSISTANT

# üß† Exercise 1 ‚Äì Using Conditional Statements and Logical Operators in Bash

In this exercise, you learned how to use **conditional logic** in a Bash script ‚Äî specifically using the `if`, `elif`, and `else` structure.

You built a script that:

- Asks the user a yes/no question
- Stores their response
- Responds differently depending on whether they typed `"y"` or `"n"`
- Handles invalid input gracefully

This is a foundational skill for writing **interactive shell scripts**.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 1.1 Create a New Bash Script

#### Create and make it executable:

```bash
echo '#!/bin/bash' > conditional_script.sh
chmod u+x conditional_script.sh
```

> This creates a new script file with execute permissions for the owner.

---

### üîπ 1.2 Prompt the User and Store Their Response

#### Add code to ask a question and store input:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo 'Are you enjoying this course so far?'
echo -n "Enter \"y\" for yes, \"n\" for no: "
read response
```

- `echo` prints messages to the screen
- `echo -n` prevents a newline after printing (keeps prompt on same line)
- `read response` stores user input in a variable called `response`

---

### üîπ 1.3 Use a Conditional Block Based on User Input

#### Add the conditional logic:

```bash
if [ "$response" == "y" ]; then
    echo "I'm pleased to hear you are enjoying the course!"
    echo "Your feedback regarding what you have been enjoying would be most welcome!"

elif [ "$response" = "n" ]; then
    echo "I'm sorry to hear you are not enjoying the course."
    echo "Your feedback regarding what we can do to improve the learning experience"
    echo "for this course would be greatly appreciated!"

else
    echo "Your response must be either 'y' or 'n'."
    echo "Please re-run the script to try again."
fi
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Uses of Conditional Logic

Conditional statements like this are used for:

- Validating user input in setup scripts
- Checking system conditions before performing actions
- Controlling flow in automation tools
- Writing interactive CLI apps in Bash

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Always quote variables to avoid unexpected behavior:
  ```bash
  if [ "$response" = "y" ]; then
  ```
- Use `[[ ... ]]` instead of `[ ... ]` for advanced features (like regex matching) in modern Bash
- You can simplify responses by converting input to lowercase:
  ```bash
  response="${response,,}"
  ```

# üßÆ Exercise 2 ‚Äì Performing Basic Math and Logical Comparisons in Bash

In this hands-on exercise, you created a **Bash script** that:

- Accepts two integers from the user
- Performs basic math: addition and multiplication
- Compares results using **numeric conditional operators**
- Outputs comparison results to the user

This helps you understand how to work with **arithmetic operations**, **variables**, and **numerical logic** in shell scripting.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 2.1 Create a Bash Script for Input and Calculations

You created a script that takes two integers as input:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo -n "Enter an integer: "
read n1
echo -n "Enter another integer: "
read n2
```

Then calculated:

```bash
sum=$(($n1 + $n2))
product=$(($n1 * $n2))
```

And printed the result:

```bash
echo "The sum of $n1 and $n2 is $sum"
echo "The product of $n1 and $n2 is $product."
```

> üìù The syntax `$(())` is used in Bash for **arithmetic expansion** ‚Äî it evaluates mathematical expressions.

---

### üîπ 2.2 Add Logic to Compare Results

You added an `if-elif-else` block to compare the **sum** and **product**:

```bash
if [ $sum -lt $product ]; then
   echo "The sum is less than the product."
elif [[ $sum == $product ]]; then
   echo "The sum is equal to the product."
elif [ $sum -gt $product ]; then
   echo "The sum is greater than the product."
fi
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: You used `-lt`, `-gt`, and `==` for numeric comparisons.

| Operator | Meaning               |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| `-lt`    | Less than             |
| `-le`    | Less than or equal    |
| `-eq`    | Equal                 |
| `-ge`    | Greater than or equal |
| `-gt`    | Greater than          |

---

## üß™ Sample Output Scenarios

### Case 1: Sum < Product

```
Enter an integer: 3
Enter another integer: 5
The sum of 3 and 5 is 8
The product of 3 and 5 is 15.
The sum is less than the product.
```

### Case 2: Sum == Product

```
Enter an integer: 2
Enter another integer: 2
The sum of 2 and 2 is 4
The product of 2 and 2 is 4.
The sum is equal to the product.
```

### Case 3: Sum > Product

```
Enter an integer: 5
Enter another integer: 1
The sum of 5 and 1 is 6
The product of 5 and 1 is 5.
The sum is greater than the product.
```

---

## üìã Summary Table

| Task                           | Command                            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Read user input                | `read var_name`                    |
| Perform arithmetic             | `$(($n1 + $n2))`, `$(($n1 * $n2))` |
| Print formatted output         | `echo "Result: $result"`           |
| Compare numbers (less than)    | `[ $a -lt $b ]`                    |
| Compare numbers (equal)        | `[ $a -eq $b ]`                    |
| Compare numbers (greater than) | `[ $a -gt $b ]`                    |

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Always use spaces around operators:

  ```bash
  # Correct
  if [ $a -gt $b ]

  # Incorrect
  if [$a-gt$b] ‚ùå
  ```

- Validate input (optional enhancement):

  ```bash
  if ! [[ "$n1" =~ ^[0-9]+$ && "$n2" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
      echo "Please enter valid integers."
      exit 1
  fi
  ```

  This checks if both inputs are integers before doing calculations.

- Use `let` for inline assignments:

  ```bash
  let sum=n1+n2
  ```

- Or use alternative syntax:
  ```bash
  (( sum = n1 + n2 ))
  ```

---

## ü§ì Why This Matters

You're now able to:

- Handle **user input**
- Perform **basic math** in Bash scripts
- Use **conditional logic** based on numerical comparisons
- Write more advanced scripts that can handle **dynamic user data**

These skills form the foundation for writing **interactive**, **logical**, and **automated** command-line tools in Linux.

### ASSISTANT

# üßÆ Exercise 3 ‚Äì Using Arrays and For Loops in Bash Scripts

In this exercise, you learned how to:

- **Download and inspect a CSV file**
- **Extract columns into arrays using `cut`**
- **Create a new array by performing arithmetic on other arrays**
- **Combine data back into a new CSV report using `paste`**

This is a powerful demonstration of how **Bash scripting can be used for basic data processing** ‚Äî especially when working with structured text files like CSVs.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 3.1 Download the CSV File

You downloaded a sample dataset:

```bash
csv_file="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-LX0117EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/M3/L2/arrays_table.csv"
wget $csv_file
```

This gave you a file named `arrays_table.csv`.

---

### üîπ 3.2 View the CSV Content

You inspected it with:

```bash
cat arrays_table.csv
```

Example content:

```
column_0,column_1,column_2
A,10,50
B,20,40
C,30,30
D,40,20
E,50,10
```

Each line represents a row, and each column holds different types of data.

---

### üîπ 3.3 Parse Columns into Arrays

You extracted each column using `cut` and stored them in **Bash arrays**:

```bash
column_0=($(cut -d "," -f 1 $csv_file))
column_1=($(cut -d "," -f 2 $csv_file))
column_2=($(cut -d "," -f 3 $csv_file))
```

> üí° This uses **command substitution** (`$(...)`) to populate arrays from command output.

Then you printed one of them:

```bash
echo "${column_0[@]}"
```

Output:

```
column_0 A B C D E
```

Note: The first element is the header (`column_0`, `column_1`, etc.)

---

### üîπ 3.4 Create a New Array as a Difference Between Two Columns

You created a new array, `column_3`, which stores the difference between `column_2` and `column_1`.

#### Initialize with header:

```bash
column_3=("column_3")
```

#### Count lines in the CSV:

```bash
nlines=$(cat $csv_file | wc -l)
```

#### Loop through rows and calculate:

```bash
for ((i=1; i<$nlines; i++)); do
  column_3[$i]=$((column_2[i] - column_1[i]))
done
```

Then you printed the result:

```bash
echo "${column_3[@]}"
```

Example output:

```
column_3 40 20 0 -20 -40
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Bash supports only integer math ‚Äî so this works perfectly for numeric columns.

---

### üîπ 3.5 Combine New Column with Original CSV

You wrote the new column to a temporary file:

```bash
echo "${column_3[0]}" > column_3.txt
for ((i=1; i<nlines; i++)); do
  echo "${column_3[$i]}" >> column_3.txt
done
```

Then merged it with the original CSV:

```bash
paste -d "," $csv_file column_3.txt > report.csv
```

Now `report.csv` contains all four columns!

Example output:

```
column_0,column_1,column_2,column_3
A,10,50,40
B,20,40,20
C,30,30,0
D,40,20,-20
E,50,10,-40
```

| Write array to file      | `echo "value" >> file.txt`              |
| Merge files side-by-side | `paste -d "," file1 file2 > output.csv` |

---

## üß† Why This Matters

This exercise introduced you to:

- **Array manipulation** in Bash
- **Looping through indexed elements**
- Performing **basic arithmetic**
- Working with **CSV data** via shell commands

These skills are useful for:

- Processing logs or flat-file databases
- Automating simple data transformations
- Building lightweight reporting tools without external dependencies

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Use `${array[@]}` to access all elements in an array
- Remember array indexing starts at 0
- Always quote variables to avoid issues:
  ```bash
  echo "${column_0[@]}"
  ```
- You can validate that arrays have the same length before merging:
  ```bash
  [[ ${#column_0[@]} -eq ${#column_3[@]} ]] && echo "Arrays match in size"
  ```

Exercise 1 - Understand crontab file syntax
Cron is a system daemon used to execute desired tasks in the background at designated times.

A crontab file is a simple text file containing a list of commands meant to be run at specified times. It is edited using the crontab command.

Each line in a crontab file has five time-and-date fields, followed by a command, followed by a newline character (\n). The fields are separated by spaces.

The five time-and-date fields cannot contain spaces and their allowed values are as follows:

Field Allowed values
minute 0-59
hour 0-23, 0 = midnight
day 1-31
month 1-12
weekday 0-6, 0 = Sunday

| Schedule                              | Crontab Entry                           |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Every day at 3:00 AM                  | `0 3 * * * /scripts/daily_backup.sh`    |
| Every 5 minutes                       | `*/5 * * * * /scripts/check_health.sh`  |
| At 12:00 PM on the 1st of every month | `0 12 1 * * /scripts/monthly_report.sh` |
| Every Saturday at 1:30 AM             | `30 1 * * 6 /scripts/weekly_cleanup.sh` |

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Always test your scripts manually before adding them to `crontab`.
- Use absolute paths for scripts in cron (e.g., `/home/user/scripts/backup.sh`)
- Redirect output to a log file or `/dev/null` to avoid email spam:
  ```bash
  0 2 * * * /scripts/log_system_stats.sh >> /var/log/system_stats.log 2>&1
  ```

Exercise 3 - Add a job in the crontab file
3.1. Add a job to crontab
To add a cron job, run the command below:

1
crontab -e

Copied!
This will create a new crontab file for you (if you don't have one already). Now you are ready to add a new cron job.

Your crontab file will be opened in an editor as shown in the image below:

Scroll down to the end of the file using the arrow keys:

Add the below line at the end of the crontab file:

1
0 21 \* \* \* echo "Welcome to cron" >> /tmp/echo.txt

Copied!

The above job specifies that the echo command should run when the minute is 0 and the hour is 21. It effectively means the job runs at 9.00 p.m every day.

The output of the command should be sent to a file /tmp/echo.txt.

Press Ctrl + x to save the changes.

Press y to confirm.

Press Enter to come out of the editor.

Check if the job is added to the crontab by running the following command.

1
crontab -l

Copied!
You should see the newly added job in the output.

3.2. Schedule a shell script
Let us create a simple shell script that prints the current time and the current disk usage statistics.

Step 1: On the menu on the lab screen, use File->New File to create a new file:

Step 2: Give the file name as diskusage.sh and click 'OK'

Step 3: Save the following commands into the shell script:

1
2
3
4
5
#! /bin/bash

# print the current date time

date

# print the disk free statistics

df -h

Copied!
Step 4: Save the file using the File->Save menu option.

Step 5: Verify that the script is working:

1
2
chmod u+x diskusage.sh
./diskusage.sh

Copied!
The script should print the current timestamp and the disk usage stats.

Let us schedule this script to be run everyday at midnight 12:00 (when the hour is 0 on the 24 hour clock).
We want the output of this script to be appended to /home/project/diskusage.log.

Edit the crontab:

1
crontab -e

Copied!
Add the following line to the end of the file:

1
0 0 \* \* \* /home/project/diskusage.sh >>/home/project/diskusage.log

Copied!
Press Ctrl + x to save the changes.

Press y to confirm.

Press Enter to come out of the editor.

Check if the job is added to the crontab by running the following command:

1
crontab -l

Copied!
You should see the newly added job in the output.

### ASSISTANT

# üßë‚Äçüíª Exercise 3 ‚Äì Add a Job to the Crontab File

In this exercise, you learned how to **schedule automated tasks using cron** by editing your **crontab file**. You created and scheduled a simple Bash script to run daily at midnight and append its output to a log file.

This is a foundational skill for automating system maintenance, backups, monitoring, and more in Linux environments.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 3.1 Add a Cron Job Using `crontab -e`

You edited your crontab:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Then added the following line:

```bash
0 21 * * * echo "Welcome to cron" >> /tmp/echo.txt
```

#### This means:

| Field   | Value | Time                   |
| ------- | ----- | ---------------------- |
| Minute  | `0`   | At minute 0            |
| Hour    | `21`  | At 9:00 PM             |
| Day     | `*`   | Every day of the month |
| Month   | `*`   | Every month            |
| Weekday | `*`   | Any day of the week    |

So this job runs every day at **9:00 PM**, appending `"Welcome to cron"` to `/tmp/echo.txt`.

After saving with `Ctrl + X`, then confirming with `Y`, and pressing `Enter`, you verified it was added:

```bash
crontab -l
```

You should see:

```
0 21 * * * echo "Welcome to cron" >> /tmp/echo.txt
```

---

### üîπ 3.2 Schedule a Shell Script

#### Step 1: Create a new script called `diskusage.sh`

From the menu:  
**File ‚Üí New File ‚Üí Save as `diskusage.sh`**

You added this content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# print current date/time
date
# print disk usage stats
df -h
```

Then saved and made it executable:

```bash
chmod u+x diskusage.sh
```

You tested it:

```bash
./diskusage.sh
```

It printed:

- Current timestamp
- Disk usage in human-readable format (`df -h`)

---

#### Step 2: Schedule the Script with Cron

You opened your crontab again:

```bash
crontab -e
```

And added:

```bash
0 0 * * * /home/project/diskusage.sh >> /home/project/diskusage.log
```

This schedules the script to run:

- At **0 minutes**
- At **0 hour (midnight)**
- Every day of the month
- Every month
- On any weekday

The output is appended to `/home/project/diskusage.log` so you can review it later.

You confirmed the entry was added:

```bash
crontab -l
```

You should now see both jobs:

```
0 21 * * * echo "Welcome to cron" >> /tmp/echo.txt
0 0 * * * /home/project/diskusage.sh >> /home/project/diskusage.log
```

| --------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| `minute`  | 0‚Äì59             | `0` = top of the hour       |
| `hour`    | 0‚Äì23             | `21` = 9:00 PM              |
| `day`     | 1‚Äì31             | `*` = every day             |
| `month`   | 1‚Äì12             | `*` = every month           |
| `weekday` | 0‚Äì6 (0 = Sunday) | `*` = every day of the week |

---

## üß† Why Scheduling Matters

Using cron lets you automate essential tasks like:

- Running backups
- Cleaning up logs
- Monitoring system health
- Generating reports
- Updating software or databases

Once set up, these jobs run **automatically ‚Äî even if you're not logged in**!

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Use absolute paths in cron ‚Äî cron doesn't know what `~/scripts` means!
- Redirect output to a log file for debugging:
  ```bash
  0 0 * * * /home/project/script.sh >> /home/project/output.log 2>&1
  ```
- Test scripts manually before scheduling them
- Don‚Äôt forget to check permissions on your script: `chmod +x`

### ASSISTANT

# üßë‚Äçüíª Exercise 3 ‚Äì Add a Job in the Crontab File

In this exercise, you learned how to **schedule recurring tasks** using the `crontab` file. You added two cron jobs:

- One that echoes a message daily at 9:00 PM
- Another that runs a custom script (`diskusage.sh`) at **midnight every day**, logging output to a file.

This is an essential skill for automating repetitive system tasks like:

- Running backups
- Monitoring disk usage
- Logging events
- Sending reports

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Summary

### üîπ 3.1 Add a Daily Cron Job

You opened your crontab file with:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Then added this line:

```bash
0 21 * * * echo "Welcome to cron" >> /tmp/echo.txt
```

#### What it means:

| Field   | Value | When                   |
| ------- | ----- | ---------------------- |
| Minute  | `0`   | At the top of the hour |
| Hour    | `21`  | At 9:00 PM             |
| Day     | `*`   | Every day              |
| Month   | `*`   | Every month            |
| Weekday | `*`   | Any day                |

> This appends `"Welcome to cron"` to `/tmp/echo.txt` every night at 9 PM.

After saving with:

- **Ctrl + X**
- Pressed **Y** to confirm
- Pressed **Enter** to exit

You verified the job was saved by listing the crontab:

```bash
crontab -l
```

---

### üîπ 3.2 Schedule a Shell Script

You created a Bash script called `diskusage.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# print current date/time
date
# print disk usage stats
df -h
```

Then made it executable and tested it:

```bash
chmod u+x diskusage.sh
./diskusage.sh
```

It should have printed:

- Current time (via `date`)
- Disk usage in human-readable format (via `df -h`)

---

### üîÅ Automate It with Cron

You scheduled the script to run every day at **midnight**:

```bash
0 0 * * * /home/project/diskusage.sh >> /home/project/diskusage.log
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure the path to the script is correct ‚Äî use absolute paths!

Each day at midnight, the script will:

- Print the current timestamp
- Show disk usage statistics
- Append the output to `/home/project/diskusage.log`

This helps track disk usage over time and monitor system behavior automatically.

# üõ†Ô∏è **Practice Exercises ‚Äì Scheduling with Cron**

Here's a clean and detailed breakdown of the practice exercise you're working on:

---

## üîπ **1. Create a cron job that runs `date >> /tmp/everymin.txt` every minute**

### üí° Hint:

Use the crontab syntax:

````
*     *     *     *     *    command_to_run
|     |     |     |     |
minute hour  day  month weekday

To run something **every minute**, all five time fields should be `*`, or you can use `*` for just the minute field and set the rest to `*`.

---

### ‚úÖ **Solution:**

#### Step 1: Open your crontab file in edit mode:
```bash
crontab -e
````

#### Step 2: Add the following line at the end of the file:

```bash
* * * * * date >> /tmp/everymin.txt
```

This means:

- Run the `date` command every minute
- Append (`>>`) the output to `/tmp/everymin.txt`

#### Step 3: Save and exit

- Press `Ctrl + X` (if using Nano)
- Type `y` to confirm changes
- Press `Enter` to save to the same file

---

### üß™ What This Does:

Every minute, the current system date and time will be appended to `/tmp/everymin.txt`.

Example entry in `/tmp/everymin.txt`:

```
Sat Apr 5 10:00:00 UTC 2025
```

After one minute:

```
Sat Apr 5 10:01:00 UTC 2025
```

# üéâ **Summary ‚Äì Mastering Cron Jobs in Linux**

Great job completing this hands-on lab! You've now learned how to manage scheduled tasks using **cron**, one of the most powerful tools for automation in Linux.

---

## üîß What You Learned

Here‚Äôs a quick recap of what you practiced in this lab:

| Task                      | Command      |
| ------------------------- | ------------ |
| ‚úÖ View current cron jobs | `crontab -l` |
| ‚úèÔ∏è Edit your crontab file | `crontab -e` |
| üóëÔ∏è Remove all cron jobs   | `crontab -r` |

---

## üïí Crontab Syntax Reminder

Each line in the crontab file follows this structure:

```
minute hour day month weekday command_to_execute
```

Example:

```bash
* * * * * echo "Hello" >> /tmp/output.txt
```

You used this format to schedule recurring tasks like logging system time and disk usage.

---

## üìå Best Practices & Tips

- Always **test scripts manually** before scheduling them with cron.
- Use **absolute paths** in cron ‚Äî it doesn't know about your current directory!
- Redirect output for logging or debugging:
  ```bash
  0 0 * * * /home/project/script.sh >> /home/project/output.log 2>&1
  ```
- **Back up** your crontab before editing or removing:
  ```bash
  crontab -l > my_crontab_backup.txt
  ```

---

## üí° Real-World Automation Ideas

Now that you understand cron, try automating:

- Daily backups
- System health checks (CPU, memory, disk)
- Log rotation
- Sending automated reports or emails
- Updating repositories or checking software versions

Exercise 1 - Understand crontab file syntax
Cron is a system daemon used to execute desired tasks in the background at designated times.

A crontab file is a simple text file containing a list of commands meant to be run at specified times. It is edited using the crontab command.

Each line in a crontab file has five time-and-date fields, followed by a command, followed by a newline character (\n). The fields are separated by spaces.

The five time-and-date fields cannot contain spaces and their allowed values are as follows:

Field Allowed values
minute 0-59
hour 0-23, 0 = midnight
day 1-31
month 1-12
weekday 0-6, 0 = Sunday

---

## üîÅ **For Loops in Bash**

### Loop over range:

```bash
for i in {0..5}; do
    echo "Iteration $i"
done
```

### Loop through array items:

```bash
for item in ${my_array[@]}; do
    echo $item
done
```

### Loop with indexing:

```bash
for ((i=0; i<${#my_array[@]}; i++)); do
    echo ${my_array[$i]}
done
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Pro Tips

- Always quote your variables:
  ```bash
  echo "$HOME"
  ```
- Use `$(...)` instead of backticks for better readability
- Prefer `[[ ... ]]` over `[ ... ]` for safer comparisons
- Use `crontab -l > backup.txt` before editing or removing scheduled jobs
- Combine pipes and filters to process data efficiently

### USER

Summary & Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that:

A shell script is a program that begins with a ‚Äòshebang‚Äô directive and is used to run commands and programs. Scripting languages are interpreted rather than compiled.

Filters are shell commands. The pipe operator `|` allows you to chain filter commands.

Shell variables can be assigned values with `=` and listed using `set.` Environment variables are shell variables with extended scope, and you can list them with `env.`

Metacharacters are special characters that have meaning to the shell.

Quoting specifies whether the shell should interpret special characters as metacharacters or 'escape' them.

Input/Output, or I/O redirection, refers to a set of features used for redirecting.

You can use command substitution to replace a command with its output.

Command line arguments provide a way to pass arguments to a shell script.

In concurrent mode, multiple commands can run simultaneously.

You can schedule cron jobs to run periodically at selected times. `m h dom mon dow command` is the cron job syntax.

You can edit cron jobs by running `crontab -e,` and `crontab -l` lists all cron jobs in the cron table.

# üéâ **Summary & Highlights ‚Äì Shell Scripting Essentials**

Great job completing this module! You‚Äôve now built a strong foundation in **Bash shell scripting**, **command chaining**, and **task automation**.

Here‚Äôs a quick recap of what you‚Äôve learned:

---

## üßæ Key Concepts Covered

| Concept                                | Description                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **Shell Scripts**                      | Programs that start with `#!/bin/bash` and are interpreted, not compiled             |
| **Shebang Line**                       | `#!/bin/bash` ‚Äî tells the system which interpreter to use                            |
| **Filters + Pipes**                    | Commands like `sort`, `cut`, `uniq` can be chained using `                           | ` for powerful data processing |
| **Shell Variables**                    | Temporary storage inside a script: `my_var=value`                                    |
| **Environment Variables**              | Available to child processes; exported using `export`                                |
| **Metacharacters**                     | Special characters like `*`, `?`, `#`, and `;` used by the shell for logic           |
| **Quoting**                            | Controls interpretation of metacharacters: `' '` = literal, `" "` = expand variables |
| **I/O Redirection**                    | Send input/output to or from files using `>`, `>>`, `<`, `2>`, etc.                  |
| **Command Substitution**               | Use `$(command)` to insert output into another command or variable                   |
| **Command-line Arguments**             | Pass values to your script using `$1`, `$2`, ..., `$@`, `$#`                         |
| **Sequential vs Concurrent Execution** | Run commands one after another or in parallel using `&`                              |
| **Cron Jobs**                          | Schedule scripts to run automatically at set times using `crontab -e`                |
| **Listing Cron Jobs**                  | `crontab -l` shows all scheduled jobs                                                |
| **Conditional Logic**                  | Use `if`, `elif`, `else`, `&&`, `                                                    |                                | ` to control flow |
| **Loops and Arrays**                   | Use `for` loops and Bash arrays to process lists of items                            |

## üîç Core Syntax Reference

### üìå Crontab Format

```
m  h  dom  mon  dow  command
```

- m = minute (0‚Äì59)
- h = hour (0‚Äì23)
- dom = day of month (1‚Äì31)
- mon = month (1‚Äì12)
- dow = day of week (0‚Äì6) where 0 = Sunday

Example:

```bash
0 2 * * * /home/user/scripts/backup.sh
```

### üßÆ Arithmetic in Bash

```bash
echo $((3 + 2))        # Outputs 5
echo $((-1 * -2))      # Outputs 2
```

### üß™ Conditional Statements

```bash
if [[ $# == 2 ]]; then
  echo "Two arguments provided"
fi
```

### üîÅ For Loops

```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Iteration $i"
done
```

### üì¶ Arrays

```bash
my_array=(apple banana "orange juice" 42)
echo ${my_array[0]}     # apple
echo ${my_array[@]}     # all elements
```

Exercise 1 - Initialize your weather report log file
1.1 Create a text file called rx_poc.log
rx_poc.log will be your POC weather report log file, or a text file which contains a growing history of the daily weather data you will scrape. Each entry in the log file corresponds to a row as in Table 1.

Click here for Hint
Use the touch command or open a new text file from the GUI.

Click here for Solution
Create rx_poc.log by entering the following in your terminal:

1
touch rx_poc.log

Copied!
1.2 Add a header to your weather report
Your header should consist of the column names from Table 1, delimited by tabs.
Write the header to your weather report.

Click here for Hint
Use the echo command with the -e option, and include tab separators \t in a string of names.
Consider why the -e option is needed.

Click here for Solution
Use a shell variable and command substitution:

1
2
header=$(echo -e "year\tmonth\tday\tobs_temp\tfc_temp")
echo $header>rx_poc.log

Copied!
OR more directly, use echo and redirection:

1
echo -e "year\tmonth\tday\tobs_temp\tfc_temp">rx_poc.log

Copied!
Tip: Although it might seem redundant, it is better practice to use variables in these cases. Variables make for much cleaner code, which is easier to understand and safer to modify by others or even yourself at a later date. Using meaningful names for your variables also makes the code more "self-documenting."

### ASSISTANT

# üå§Ô∏è Exercise 1 ‚Äì Initialize Your Weather Report Log File

In this exercise, you learned how to **create and prepare a log file** for storing structured weather data.

You created:

- A log file: `rx_poc.log`
- A header row with column names separated by tabs

This is the foundation for logging weather observations and forecasts ‚Äî and a great example of how to use basic shell commands to **build reusable, maintainable scripts**.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 1.1 Create an Empty Log File

#### Command used:

```bash
touch rx_poc.log
```

- `touch` creates an empty file or updates the timestamp if it already exists
- This gives you a clean file to store your weather report data

---

### üîπ 1.2 Add a Header Line with Column Names

You added a header line using:

```bash
echo -e "year\tmonth\tday\tobs_temp\tfc_temp" > rx_poc.log
```

Or using a variable (cleaner practice):

```bash
header=$(echo -e "year\tmonth\tday\tobs_temp\tfc_temp")
echo "$header" > rx_poc.log
```

#### Why `-e` is needed:

- The `-e` option enables interpretation of escape characters like `\t` (tab) and `\n` (new line)
- Without it, `\t` would be printed literally instead of creating actual tab separators

---

| Task                          | Command                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Create empty file             | `touch rx_poc.log`                                           |
| Write header with tabs        | `echo -e "year\tmonth\tday\tobs_temp\tfc_temp" > rx_poc.log` |
| Use variable for cleaner code | `header=$(echo -e "...")` then `echo "$header" > rx_poc.log` |

---

## üß† Why This Matters

Using variables makes your scripts:

- More **readable**
- Easier to **modify**
- More **reusable**

Example:

```bash
header=$(echo -e "year\tmonth\tday\tobs_temp\tfc_temp")
echo "$header" > rx_poc.log
```

Now, if you want to change the header later, you only need to edit one line.

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Always quote variables when echoing to files:
  ```bash
  echo "$header" > rx_poc.log
  ```
- Use `>` for new files and `>>` to append more lines later
- Combine with scripts that fetch live weather data and append it daily

---

Great job setting up your **weather report log file**!  
You‚Äôve laid the groundwork for automating data collection in Linux using shell scripts.

Would you like to continue with:

Copied!
Verify your changes using the ls command with the -l option.

2.2. Assign the city name to Casablanca for accessing the weather report
Click here for Hint
Use the assignment operator

Click here for Solution
1
city=Casablanca

Copied!
2.3 Obtain the weather information for Casablanca
Click here for Hint
Use the curl command with the --output option. Saved the output to a file named weather_report.

Click here for Solution
Edit rx_poc.sh to include:

1
curl -s wttr.in/$city?T --output weather_report

### ASSISTANT

# üå§Ô∏è Exercise 2 ‚Äì Download the Raw Weather Data

In this exercise, you created a **Bash script** to automate the process of fetching **weather data** for a specific city ‚Äî in this case, **Casablanca** ‚Äî using the `curl` command.

This is a great example of how to build **reusable scripts** that fetch external data and store it locally for further processing.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 2.1 Create and Make `rx_poc.sh` Executable

#### Create the file:

```bash
touch rx_poc.sh
```

#### Add the shebang line (first line of the file):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

This tells the system to use the Bash interpreter when running the script.

#### Make it executable:

```bash
chmod u+x rx_poc.sh
```

You can verify with:

```bash
ls -l rx_poc.sh
```

You should see:

```
-rwxr--r-- 1 user group ... rx_poc.sh
```

---

### üîπ 2.2 Assign City Name Using a Shell Variable

You added this line to your script:

```bash
city=Casablanca
```

Using variables like this makes your script more flexible and easier to reuse for other cities later.

---

### üîπ 2.3 Fetch Weather Info Using `curl`

You used the `curl` command to download weather data from the **wttr.in** service:

```bash
curl -s wttr.in/$city?T --output weather_report
```

#### Explanation:

- `curl`: Command-line tool for transferring data from a URL
- `-s`: Silent mode ‚Äî suppresses progress output
- `wttr.in/$city?T`: The `?T` disables ANSI escape codes for better readability
- `--output weather_report`: Saves the result into a file called `weather_report`

> üí° Pro Tip: You can test the URL directly in your browser or terminal:
>
> ```bash
> curl -s wttr.in/Casablanca?T
> ```

| Download weather data  | `curl -s wttr.in/$city?T --output weather_report` |

---

## üß† Why This Matters

You‚Äôve now built a basic but powerful script that:

- Is **self-contained**
- Uses **variables** for flexibility
- Downloads **live weather data** from the web
- Saves it to a file for future use

This sets the stage for extracting useful info and appending it to your log file (`rx_poc.log`) in the next steps.

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Always test your script manually before scheduling:
  ```bash
  ./rx_poc.sh
  ```
- Check if the file `weather_report` was created:
  ```bash
  cat weather_report
  ```
- Use quotes around variables to prevent errors:
  ```bash
  echo "Downloading weather for $city"
  ```

Exercise 3 - Extract and load the required data
3.1. Edit rx_poc.sh to extract the required data from the raw data file and assign them to variables obs_temp and fc_temp
Extracting the required data is a process that will take some trial and error until you get it right. Study the weather report you obtained in Step 2.3, determine what you need to extract, and look for patterns.

You are looking for ways to 'chip away' at the weather report by:

Using shell commands to extract only the data you need (the signal)
Filtering everything else out (the noise)
Combining your filters into a pipeline (recall the use of pipes to chain filters together)
Click here for a Hint to get started
Extract only those lines that contain temperatures from the weather report, and save the result to variables representing the temparature output.

3.1.1. Extract the current temperature, and store it in a shell variable called obs_temp
Remember to validate your results.

You may have noticed by now that the temperature values extracted from wttr.in are surrounded by special formatting characters. These "hidden" characters cause the numbers to display in specific color - for example, when you use the cat command to display your log file.

Unfortunately you cannot perform arithmetic calculations on such formatted text, so you will need to extract the values from the surrounding formatting so you can make use of them later in this lab.

Click here for Hint 1
Which line is the current temperature on?

Click here for Hint 2
Are there any characters you can use as a delimiter to appropriately parse the line into fields?

Click here for Solution
While adding the following lines to rx_poc.sh, ensure you understand what each filter accomplishes by using the command line. Try adding one filter at a time to see what the outcome is as you develop the pipeline.

1
2
3
#To extract Current Temperature
obs_temp=$(curl -s wttr.in/$city?T | grep -m 1 '¬∞.' | grep -Eo -e '-?[[:digit:]].\*')
echo "The current Temperature of $city: $obs_temp"

Copied!
The first line uses the curl command to fetch weather information from wttr.in for the specified city ($city). It then uses a combination of grep and grep -Eo to extract the current temperature in degrees Celsius and assigns it to the variable obs_temp.

The second line (echo $obs_temp) prints the current temperature to the console.

3.1.2. Extract tomorrow's temperature forecast for noon, and store it in a shell variable called fc_temp
Click here for Hint
Provided you understand the previous pipeline, you will be able to solve this problem through experimentation.

Click here for Solution
Add to rx_poc.sh:

1
2
3

# To extract the forecast tempearature for noon tomorrow

fc_temp=$(curl -s wttr.in/$city?T | head -23 | tail -1 | grep '¬∞.' | cut -d 'C' -f2 | grep -Eo -e '-?[[:digit:]].\*')
echo "The forecasted temperature for noon tomorrow for $city : $fc_temp C"

Copied!
The first line uses a combination of head and tail to narrow down to the line containing tomorrow‚Äôs noon forecast temperature. grep and cut are employed to isolate and format the temperature information, and, the numeric part of the temperature is captured using grep -Eo.

The second line (echo $fc_temp) prints the forecast temperature for noon tomorrow to the console.

3.2. Store the current day, month, and year in corresponding shell variables
Click here for Hint
Use command substitution and the date command with the correct formatting options.
The time zone for Casablanca is UTC+1. To get the local time for Casablanca, you can set the time-zone environment variable, TZ, as follows:

1
TZ='Morocco/Casablanca'

Copied!
Click here for Solution
Add to rx_poc.sh:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
#Assign Country and City to variable TZ
TZ='Morocco/Casablanca'

# Use command substitution to store the current day, month, and year in corresponding shell variables:

day=$(TZ='Morocco/Casablanca' date -u +%d) 
month=$(TZ='Morocco/Casablanca' date +%m)
year=$(TZ='Morocco/Casablanca' date +%Y)

Copied!
Note: You might be wondering why we didn't just set hour to a value of 12, since we want to get the time at noon.
However, if we did, we would lose the ability to verify that we are actually running the code at the correct local time.You should think of the local time as a measurement rather than a set number.

3.3. Merge the fields into a tab-delimited record, corresponding to a single row in Table 1
Append the resulting record as a row of data to your weather log file.

Click here for Hint
How did you create the header to initialize your log file?

Click here for Solution
Add to rx_poc.sh:

1
2
record=$(echo -e "$year\t$month\t$day\t$obs_temp\t$fc_temp C")
echo $record>>rx_poc.log

### ASSISTANT

# üß™ Exercise 3 ‚Äì Extract and Load Required Weather Data

In this exercise, you learned how to **extract specific temperature data** from a raw weather report and **store it in variables** for later use.

You also used the `date` command with timezone settings to get **localized date values**, and finally, you built a **tab-delimited record** and appended it to your log file ‚Äî bringing together all the skills you've been building so far:

- Variables
- Command substitution
- Text filtering with `grep`, `cut`, `head`, and `tail`
- I/O redirection and logging

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 3.1 Edit `rx_poc.sh` to extract required data

#### 3.1.1 Extract Current Temperature (`obs_temp`)

```bash
obs_temp=$(curl -s wttr.in/$city?T | grep -m 1 '¬∞.' | grep -Eo -e '-?[[:digit:]].*')
echo "The current Temperature of $city: $obs_temp"
```

- `curl`: Fetches weather data silently
- `grep -m 1 '¬∞.'`: Gets first line with a degree symbol (current temp)
- `grep -Eo -e '-?[[:digit:]].*'`: Extracts only the numeric part (e.g., `-5¬∞C`, `+25¬∞F`)
- Assigns result to `obs_temp` using `$(...)` command substitution

---

#### 3.1.2 Extract Tomorrow's Noon Forecast (`fc_temp`)

```bash
fc_temp=$(curl -s wttr.in/$city?T | head -23 | tail -1 | grep '¬∞.' | cut -d 'C' -f2 | grep -Eo -e '-?[[:digit:]].*')
echo "The forecasted temperature for noon tomorrow for $city : $fc_temp C"
```

- `head -23`: Skips header lines and gets to tomorrow‚Äôs section
- `tail -1`: Isolates the last line processed so far
- `grep '¬∞.'`: Finds the temperature line
- `cut -d 'C' -f2`: Removes the color formatting before the number
- `grep -Eo`: Extracts just the numeric value

---

### üîπ 3.2 Store Day, Month, and Year in Shell Variables

```bash
TZ='Morocco/Casablanca'
day=$(TZ='Morocco/Casablanca' date -u +%d)
month=$(TZ='Morocco/Casablanca' date +%m)
year=$(TZ='Morocco/Casablanca' date +%Y)
```

- You set the `TZ` variable to ensure accurate local time for Casablanca
- Used `date` with format specifiers:
  - `%d` = day
  - `%m` = month
  - `%Y` = full year

> üí° Note: The `date -u` ensures consistent behavior across time zones by working in UTC internally

---

### üîπ 3.3 Merge Fields into a Tab-Delimited Record and Append to Log

```bash
record=$(echo -e "$year\t$month\t$day\t$obs_temp\t$fc_temp C")
echo "$record" >> rx_poc.log
```

- `echo -e`: Enables interpretation of escape characters like `\t` (tab)
- `$record`: Holds one complete row of structured data
- `>> rx_poc.log`: Appends the new row to your log file

After running this script once, your `rx_poc.log` should look like:

```
year	month	day	obs_temp	fc_temp
2025	04	05	+22	+20
```

## üß† Why This Matters

This script demonstrates real-world automation:

- It fetches live data from the web
- Parses meaningful values from noisy output
- Logs structured data into a file
- Uses environment variables and shell logic effectively

These are essential steps toward creating robust **data pipelines**, **monitoring tools**, and **automated reports** in Linux.

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Always quote your variables when echoing to files:
  ```bash
  echo "$record" >> rx_poc.log
  ```
- Test each filter step-by-step:
  ```bash
  curl -s wttr.in/Casablanca?T | grep -m 1 '¬∞.'
  ```
- Use `cat rx_poc.log` or `tail rx_poc.log` to verify results
- Schedule your script daily using `cron` to build a long-term weather dataset!

Exercise 4 - Schedule your Bash script rx_poc.sh to run every day at noon local time
4.1. Determine what time of day to run your script
Recall that you want to load the weather data coresponding to noon, local time, in Casablanca every day.

First, check the time difference between your system's default time zone and UTC.

Click here for Hint 1
Use the date command twice with appropriate options; once to get your system time, and once to get UTC.

Click here for Solution
Running the following commands gives you the info you need to get the time difference between your system and UTC.

3
4
$ date
Mon Feb 13 11:28:12 EST 2023
$ date -u
Mon Feb 13 16:28:16 UTC 2023

Now you can determine how many hours difference there are between your system's local time and that of Casablanca. In the example above, we see that the system time relative to UTC is UTC+5 (i.e. 16 - 11 = 5).

We know Casablanca is UTC+1, so the system time relative to Casablanca is 4 hours earlier. Thus to run your script at noon Casablanca time, you need to run it at 8 am.

### ASSISTANT

# üå§Ô∏è Exercise 4 ‚Äì Schedule Your Bash Script `rx_poc.sh` to Run Daily at Noon (Casablanca Time)

In this exercise, you learned how to **schedule your weather report script** (`rx_poc.sh`) to run automatically every day at **noon local time in Casablanca** using the **cron scheduler**.

This is a key step toward **automating data collection workflows**, and it demonstrates how to:

- Account for **timezone differences**
- Use `crontab -e` to schedule jobs
- Append structured weather data to a log file daily

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 4.1 Determine Correct UTC Time for Noon in Casablanca

You checked your system's current time and UTC time:

```bash
date
date -u
```

Example output:

```
Mon Feb 13 11:28:12 EST 2023
Mon Feb 13 16:28:16 UTC 2023
```

Your system was 5 hours ahead of UTC, but Casablanca is only **UTC+1**, so you determined that **8 AM system time = 12 PM Casablanca time**

> This ensures your script runs at **local noon in Casablanca**, even if your server is in another timezone.

---

### üîπ 4.2 Create a Cron Job to Run Your Script Daily at 8 AM System Time

You edited your crontab:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Then added the job:

```bash
0 8 * * * /home/project/rx_poc.sh
```

This line means:
| Field | Value | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| minute | `0` | At the top of the hour |
| hour | `8` | At 8:00 AM |
| day | `*` | Every day |
| month | `*` | Every month |
| weekday | `*` | Any day of the week |

So this will run your script every morning at **8 AM system time**, which corresponds to **12 PM local time in Casablanca** due to the UTC offset.

---

### üîπ 4.3 Full Solution ‚Äì Weather Logging Script

Here‚Äôs the complete `rx_poc.sh` script for reference:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Assign city name as Casablanca
city=Casablanca

# Obtain the weather report for Casablanca
curl -s wttr.in/$city?T --output weather_report

# To extract Current Temperature
obs_temp=$(curl -s wttr.in/$city?T | grep -m 1 '¬∞.' | grep -Eo -e '-?[[:digit:]].*')
echo "The current Temperature of $city: $obs_temp"

# To extract tomorrow‚Äôs forecast temperature for noon
fc_temp=$(curl -s wttr.in/$city?T | head -23 | tail -1 | grep '¬∞.' | cut -d 'C' -f2 | grep -Eo -e '-?[[:digit:]].*')
echo "The forecasted temperature for noon tomorrow for $city : $fc_temp C"

# Set timezone to Casablanca
TZ='Morocco/Casablanca'

# Store current date parts
day=$(TZ='Morocco/Casablanca' date -u +%d)
month=$(TZ='Morocco/Casablanca' date +%m)
year=$(TZ='Morocco/Casablanca' date +%Y)

# Build record with tabs
record=$(echo -e "$year\t$month\t$day\t$obs_temp\t$fc_temp C")

# Append to log file
echo "$record" >> rx_poc.log

## üß† Why Scheduling Matters

Automating tasks like this helps you:

- Collect data **without manual intervention**
- Maintain a **long-term dataset**
- Ensure consistency across time zones
- Free up time for more complex analysis later

This kind of setup is used widely in:

- **Weather monitoring**
- **Log aggregation**
- **Daily reports**
- **System health checks**

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Always test scripts manually before scheduling:
  ```bash
  ./rx_poc.sh
  ```
- Check logs after running:
  ```bash
  cat rx_poc.log
  ```
- Schedule with care ‚Äî use `crontab -l` often to verify scheduled jobs
- Redirect both stdout and stderr for debugging:
  ```bash
  0 8 * * * /home/project/rx_poc.sh >> /tmp/weather.log 2>&1
  ```

Exercise 5 - Create a script to report historical forecasting accuracy
Now that you've created an ETL shell script to gather weather data into a report, let's create another script to measure and report the accuracy of the forecasted temperatures against the actuals.

To start, create a tab-delimited file named historical_fc_accuracy.tsv.
Insert the following code into the file to include a header with column names:

1
echo -e "year\tmonth\tday\tobs_temp\tfc_temp\taccuracy\taccuracy_range" > historical_fc_accuracy.tsv

Copied!
One key difference between this report and the previous report you generated is that the forecast temperature will now be aligned with the date the forecast is for. As a result, the date will be in the same row as the observed temperature for that date, rather than the previous row on the day that the forecast was made.

Also create an executable Bash script called fc_accuracy.sh.
Rather than scheduling your new script to run periodically, think of it as a tool you can use to generate the historical forecast accuracy on demand.

5.1. Determine the difference between today's forecasted and actual temperatures
Rather than writing the script to process all of the data at once, let's simplify by solving the problem for just one instance. Later you can modify the script to handle the general case of mupltiple days.

5.1.1. Extract the forecasted and observed temperatures for today and store them in variables
Click here for Hint 1
Look up the record from yesterday.

Click here for Hint 2
Extract the forecast from the appropriate field.

today_temp=$(tail -1 rx_poc.log | cut -d " " -f4)
accuracy=$(($yesterday_fc-$today_temp))
echo "accuracy is $accuracy"

Copied!
Tip: Your weather report must have at least two days of data for this calulation to make sense.
To test your code you can simply append some artificial data to your weather report, rx_poc.log.

5.2. Assign a label to each forecast based on its accuracy
Let's set the accuracy labels according to the range that the accuracy fits most tightly within, according to the following table. Validate your result.

accuracy range accuracy label
+/- 1 deg excellent
+/- 2 deg good
+/- 3 deg fair
+/- 4 deg poor

5.5. Generalization to all days
We leave it as an exercise for you to generalize your code to create the entire weather accuracy history. In the next exercise, you will download and work with a synthetic version of this weather accuracy history report.

Here are some suggestions to guide you should you wish to create the weather accuracy history yourself:

Iterate through your weather log file using a for loop. On each iteration:
Use head and tail to extract consecutive pairs of lines on each iteration
This provides you with the current and previous day's data
Treat this pair of lines like you did in your code as yesterday and today's data
Perform your accuracy calulations as before
Use the correct row to extract date information
Append your resulting data to your historical forecast accuracy report

### ASSISTANT

# üìä Exercise 5 ‚Äì Create a Script to Report Historical Forecast Accuracy

In this exercise, you created a **new Bash script** called `fc_accuracy.sh` that analyzes the accuracy of temperature forecasts stored in your `rx_poc.log` file.

You built logic to:

- Extract forecasted and observed temperatures
- Calculate the difference (forecast error)
- Assign an **accuracy label** based on how close the forecast was to the actual temperature
- Append a new row to a **historical accuracy report**: `historical_fc_accuracy.tsv`

This is a great example of how Linux scripting can be used for **data analysis**, not just automation!

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 5.1 Determine the Difference Between Forecasted and Observed Temperatures

#### 5.1.1 Extract Forecasted and Observed Temps

You extracted yesterday‚Äôs forecast from the second-to-last line of `rx_poc.log`:

```bash
yesterday_fc=$(tail -2 rx_poc.log | head -1 | cut -d " " -f5)
```

Then today's observed temperature from the last line:

```bash
today_temp=$(tail -1 rx_poc.log | cut -d " " -f4)
```

> üí° These commands use `tail`, `head`, and `cut` to parse tabular data directly in the shell ‚Äî no external tools required!

---

#### 5.1.2 Calculate Forecast Accuracy

You calculated the difference between forecast and actual:

```bash
accuracy=$(($yesterday_fc - $today_temp))
echo "accuracy is $accuracy"
```

This gives a numeric value representing how accurate the previous day‚Äôs forecast was.

---

### üîπ 5.2 Assign Accuracy Labels Based on Range

You added conditional logic to categorize the forecast accuracy:

```bash
if [ -1 -le $accuracy ] && [ $accuracy -le 1 ]; then
    accuracy_range=excellent
elif [ -2 -le $accuracy ] && [ $accuracy -le 2 ]; then
    accuracy_range=good
elif [ -3 -le $accuracy ] && [ $accuracy -le 3 ]; then
    accuracy_range=fair
else
    accuracy_range=poor
fi
```

| Accuracy Range | Label     |
| -------------- | --------- |
| ¬±1¬∞C           | excellent |
| ¬±2¬∞C           | good      |
| ¬±3¬∞C           | fair      |
| > ¬±3¬∞C         | poor      |

This shows how to build **decision-making logic into Bash scripts** using conditionals.

---

### üîπ 5.3 Append Record to Historical Accuracy File

You built a record line by line using fields from the log:

```bash
row=$(tail -1 rx_poc.log)
year=$(echo $row | cut -d " " -f1)
month=$(echo $row | cut -d " " -f2)
day=$(echo $row | cut -d " " -f3)
```

Then appended everything to your accuracy file:

```bash
echo -e "$year\t$month\t$day\t$today_temp\t$yesterday_fc\t$accuracy\t$accuracy_range" >> historical_fc_accuracy.tsv
```

You now have a structured, tab-separated history of forecast accuracy!

---

### üîπ 5.4 Full Script: `fc_accuracy.sh`

Here‚Äôs the complete script you built:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Extract yesterday's forecast
yesterday_fc=$(tail -2 rx_poc.log | head -1 | cut -d " " -f5)

# Extract today's observed temperature
today_temp=$(tail -1 rx_poc.log | cut -d " " -f4)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy=$(($yesterday_fc - $today_temp))

# Print accuracy result
echo "accuracy is $accuracy"

# Evaluate accuracy range
if [ -1 -le $accuracy ] && [ $accuracy -le 1 ]; then
    accuracy_range=excellent
elif [ -2 -le $accuracy ] && [ $accuracy -le 2 ]; then
    accuracy_range=good
elif [ -3 -le $accuracy ] && [ $accuracy -le 3 ]; then
    accuracy_range=fair
else
    accuracy_range=poor
fi

# Print final category
echo "Forecast accuracy is $accuracy_range"

# Extract date fields
row=$(tail -1 rx_poc.log)
year=$(echo $row | cut -d " " -f1)
month=$(echo $row | cut -d " " -f2)
day=$(echo $row | cut -d " " -f3)

# Build and append the record
record=$(echo -e "$year\t$month\t$day\t$today_temp\t$yesterday_fc\t$accuracy\t$accuracy_range")
echo -e "$record" >> historical_fc_accuracy.tsv
```

---

### üîÅ 5.5 Generalizing to All Days

You were encouraged to expand the script to analyze all days in your weather log.

#### Suggested Approach Using a Loop:

```bash
for ((i=2; i<$(wc -l rx_poc.log); i++)); do
    yesterday_line=$(head -$i rx_poc.log | tail -1)
    today_line=$(head -$(($i+1)) rx_poc.log | tail -1)

    # extract values and compute accuracy...
done
```

This would allow you to process multiple days and generate a full historical report.

## üß† Why This Matters

This script demonstrates how you can use Bash to:

- Analyze time-series data
- Compare expected vs actual values
- Generate structured reports
- Automate decision-making with conditionals

These are essential skills for:

- Data validation
- Forecasting systems
- Quality control pipelines
- Log analysis and system monitoring

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Always test scripts manually before running them:
  ```bash
  ./fc_accuracy.sh
  ```
- Use `cat historical_fc_accuracy.tsv` to verify results
- Consider adding logging or email alerts as enhancements
- You can improve error handling by checking if files exist or have enough lines

### ASSISTANT

# üìä Exercise 6 ‚Äì Create a Script to Report Weekly Statistics of Historical Forecasting Accuracy

In this exercise, you built a **Bash script** that:

- Downloads a synthetic dataset of historical weather forecast accuracy
- Extracts the **last 7 days** of forecast errors
- Converts them into **absolute values**
- Calculates and reports the **minimum and maximum absolute errors**

This demonstrates how Bash can be used not just for automation, but also for basic **data analysis**, **statistics**, and **array manipulation**.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 6.1 Download the Synthetic Dataset

You downloaded a sample file using `wget`:

```bash
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-LX0117EN-Coursera/labs/synthetic_historical_fc_accuracy.tsv
```

This file contains tab-separated data like:

```
year	month	day	obs_temp	fc_temp	accuracy	accuracy_range
2025	04	01	+22	+23	-1	poor
...
```

---

### üîπ 6.2 Load Last Week‚Äôs Data into an Array

#### Extract last 7 entries (days) from the file:

```bash
tail -7 synthetic_historical_fc_accuracy.tsv | cut -f6 > scratch.txt
```

- `tail -7`: gets the last 7 lines
- `cut -f6`: extracts the **accuracy** column
- `> scratch.txt`: saves it temporarily

Then load into a Bash array:

```bash
week_fc=($(cat scratch.txt))
```

Or more precisely:

```bash
week_fc=($(echo $(tail -7 synthetic_historical_fc_accuracy.tsv | cut -f6)))
```

You validated it by printing each element:

```bash
for i in {0..6}; do
    echo ${week_fc[$i]}
done
```

---

### üîπ 6.3 Calculate Min and Max Absolute Errors

#### Convert negative values to positive:

```bash
for i in {0..6}; do
    if [[ ${week_fc[$i]} < 0 ]]; then
        week_fc[$i]=$(( -1 * ${week_fc[$i]} ))
    fi
done
```

Now all errors are **positive**, representing **absolute error**.

#### Initialize min and max:

```bash
minimum=${week_fc[0]}
maximum=${week_fc[0]}
```

#### Loop through the array and update:

```bash
for item in ${week_fc[@]}; do
    if [[ $item -lt $minimum ]]; then
        minimum=$item
    fi
    if [[ $item -gt $maximum ]]; then
        maximum=$item
    fi
done
```

Finally, print the results:

```bash
echo "Minimum absolute error = $minimum"
echo "Maximum absolute error = $maximum"
```

## üß† Why This Matters

You're now writing Bash scripts that go beyond simple automation ‚Äî they're performing **real data analysis tasks**:

- Loading data
- Transforming values
- Applying logic
- Computing statistics

These skills apply directly to:

- Log file analysis
- System performance tracking
- Quality control pipelines
- DevOps monitoring tools

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Use `abs()` logic in Bash with ternary expressions:
  ```bash
  abs=${value#-}   # Removes leading '-' if present
  ```
- Use `awk` for cleaner min/max calculations:
  ```bash
  awk '{ sum += $1 } END { print sum }' scratch.txt
  ```
- Always quote variables to avoid issues:
  ```bash
  echo "${week_fc[@]}"
  ```

### USER

Task 1
Navigate to # [TASK 1] in the code.

Set two variables equal to the values of the first and second command line arguments, as follows:

Set targetDirectory to the first command line argument
Set destinationDirectory to the second command line argument
This task is meant to help with code readability.

Click here for Hint
The command line arguments interpreted by the script can be accessed via $1 (first argument) and $2 (second argument).

Take a screenshot of the code above and save it as 01-Set_Variables.jpg or .png.

Task 2
Display the values of the two command line arguments in the terminal.
Click here for Hint
Remember, you can use the command echo as a print command.

Example: echo "The year is $year"
Take a screenshot of the code above and save it as 02-Display_Values.jpg or .png.
Task 3
Define a variable called currentTS as the current timestamp, expressed in seconds.
Click here for Hint
Remember you can customize the output format of the date command.

To set a variable equal to the output of a command you can use command substitution: $() or ` `

For example: currentYear=$(date +%Y)
Take a screenshot of the code above and save it as 03-CurrentTS.jpg or .png.
Task 4
Define a variable called backupFileName to store the name of the archived and compressed backup file that the script will create.
The variable backupFileName should have the value "backup-[$currentTS].tar.gz"

For example, if currentTS has the value 1634571345, then backupFileName should have the value backup-1634571345.tar.gz.
Take a screenshot of the code above and save it as 04-Set_Value.jpg or .png.
Task 5
Define a variable called origAbsPath with the absolute path of the current directory as the variable's value.
Click here for Hint
You can get the absolute path of the current directory using the pwd command.

Take a screenshot of the code above and save it as 05-Define_Variable.jpg or .png.
Task 6
Define a variable called destAbsPath whose value equals the absolute path of the destination directory.
Click here for Hint
First use cd to go to destinationDirectory, then use the same method you used in Task 5.

Note: Please Note that you can also use the cd ‚ÄúdestinationDirectory‚Äù || exit which ensures that if the specified directory is incorrect or inaccessible, the script will terminate immediately at this step. This acts as an implicit validation check to confirm that the correct directory is provided before proceeding with further operations. Follow the same for Task 7 .

### ASSISTANT

# üõ†Ô∏è **Final Project Task Guide ‚Äì Shell Scripting Basics**

Below is a clear, step-by-step explanation of how to complete each task in your script. These tasks are typically part of a Bash script that handles **file backups**, using command-line arguments and timestamps.

---

## üîπ **Task 1: Set Variables from Command Line Arguments**

### Goal:

Set two variables:

- `targetDirectory` = first argument (`$1`)
- `destinationDirectory` = second argument (`$2`)

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
targetDirectory=$1
destinationDirectory=$2
```

This improves code readability by giving meaningful names to the input values.

üìÅ Example usage later:

```bash
./backup_script.sh /home/user/docs /home/user/backup
```

> üí° Screenshot name: `01-Set_Variables.jpg` or `.png`

---

## üîπ **Task 2: Display the Values of the Two Arguments**

### Goal:

Print the values of `targetDirectory` and `destinationDirectory` to verify they were passed correctly.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
echo "Target Directory: $targetDirectory"
echo "Destination Directory: $destinationDirectory"
```

You can also use a single line:

```bash
echo "Target: $targetDirectory | Destination: $destinationDirectory"
```

> üí° Screenshot name: `02-Display_Values.jpg` or `.png`

---

## üîπ **Task 3: Define `currentTS` as Current Timestamp (in Seconds)**

### Goal:

Create a variable `currentTS` that holds the current time as a Unix timestamp (seconds since Jan 1, 1970).

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
currentTS=$(date +%s)
```

Or with backticks (legacy syntax):

```bash
currentTS=`date +%s`
```

This is useful for generating unique filenames like `backup-1634571345.tar.gz`.

> üí° Screenshot name: `03-CurrentTS.jpg` or `.png`

---

## üîπ **Task 4: Create `backupFileName` Using `currentTS`**

### Goal:

Define a variable called `backupFileName` with the format:

```
backup-[timestamp].tar.gz
```

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
backupFileName="backup-$currentTS.tar.gz"
```

This uses **variable interpolation** to build dynamic filenames.

Example output:

```
backup-1717582345.tar.gz
```

> üí° Screenshot name: `04-Set_Value.jpg` or `.png`

---

## üîπ **Task 5: Define `origAbsPath` as Absolute Path of Current Directory**

### Goal:

Store the full path of the current working directory in `origAbsPath`.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
origAbsPath=$(pwd)
```

This helps preserve where you started the script from, which is important when changing directories during execution.

> üí° Screenshot name: `05-Define_Variable.jpg` or `.png`

---

## üîπ **Task 6: Define `destAbsPath` as Absolute Path of Destination Directory**

### Goal:

Go into the destination directory and get its absolute path.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cd "$destinationDirectory" || exit
destAbsPath=$(pwd)
```

The `|| exit` ensures the script stops if it cannot access the destination folder ‚Äî an important safety check.

> üí° Screenshot name: `06-Define_Variable.jpg` or `.png`

---

## ‚úÖ Final Code Snapshot

Here's what your script should look like so far:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# [TASK 1] Assign command line arguments
targetDirectory=$1
destinationDirectory=$2

# [TASK 2] Display values
echo "Target Directory: $targetDirectory"
echo "Destination Directory: $destinationDirectory"

# [TASK 3] Get current timestamp in seconds
currentTS=$(date +%s)

# [TASK 4] Build backup file name
backupFileName="backup-$currentTS.tar.gz"

# [TASK 5] Save original absolute path
origAbsPath=$(pwd)

# [TASK 6] Navigate to destination and save its path
cd "$destinationDirectory" || exit
destAbsPath=$(pwd)
```

| 1    | `targetDirectory`      | `$1`                                |
| 1    | `destinationDirectory` | `$2`                                |
| 2    | `echo`                 | Print both variables                |
| 3    | `currentTS`            | `$(date +%s)`                       |
| 4    | `backupFileName`       | `"backup-$currentTS.tar.gz"`        |
| 5    | `origAbsPath`          | `$(pwd)`                            |
| 6    | `destAbsPath`          | `cd "$destinationDirectory" && pwd` |

---

## üß† Why This Matters

These tasks form the foundation of any **automated backup script**:

- You‚Äôre capturing user input via **command-line arguments**
- Creating **unique archive names** with timestamps
- Working safely with **paths and directories**
- Ensuring scripts fail early on errors (e.g., bad paths)

Task 7
Change directories from the current working directory to the target directory targetDirectory.
Click here for Hint
cd into the original directory origAbsPath and then cd into targetDirectory.

Take a screenshot of the code above and save it as 07-Change_Directory.jpg or .png.
Task 8
You need to find files that have been updated within the past 24 hours. This means you need to find all files whose last-modified date was 24 hours ago or less.

To do make this easier:

Define a numerical variable called yesterdayTS as the timestamp (in seconds) 24 hours prior to the current timestamp, currentTS.
Click here for Hint
Math can be done using $(()), for example:

zero=$((3 \* 5 - 6 - 9))
Thus, to get the timestamp in seconds of 24 hours in the future, you would use:

tomorrowTS=$(($currentTS + 24 _ 60 _ 60))
Take a screenshot of the code above and save it as 08-YesterdayTS.jpg or .png.

### ASSISTANT

# üõ†Ô∏è **Final Project Task Guide ‚Äì Tasks 7 and 8**

Here's a clear breakdown of how to complete the next two tasks in your Bash script.

---

## üîπ **Task 7: Change Directories to `targetDirectory`**

### Goal:

Navigate from the current working directory to the **target directory** provided as the first command-line argument (`$1`).

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cd "$origAbsPath" || exit
cd "$targetDirectory" || exit
```

- `"$origAbsPath"` ensures you return to where the script started (from Task 5)
- Then you move into `"targetDirectory"` ‚Äî the folder to be backed up
- The `|| exit` part ensures the script stops if it can't access the directory ‚Äî this is a best practice for error handling

> üí° Screenshot name: `07-Change_Directory.jpg` or `.png`

---

## üîπ **Task 8: Define `yesterdayTS` as Timestamp from 24 Hours Ago**

### Goal:

Create a variable called `yesterdayTS` that holds the Unix timestamp for **24 hours before now**, using math inside the shell.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

Since there are:

- 60 seconds in a minute
- 60 minutes in an hour
- 24 hours in a day

You can calculate yesterday‚Äôs timestamp like this:

```bash
yesterdayTS=$(($currentTS - 24 * 60 * 60))
```

Or more explicitly:

```bash
seconds_per_day=$((24 * 60 * 60))
yesterdayTS=$(($currentTS - $seconds_per_day))
```

This gives you a reference point to find files modified in the last 24 hours.

> üí° Screenshot name: `08-YesterdayTS.jpg` or `.png`

## ‚úÖ Final Code Snapshot

Here‚Äôs what your script should look like after completing **Tasks 7 and 8**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# [TASK 1]
targetDirectory=$1
destinationDirectory=$2

# [TASK 2]
echo "Target Directory: $targetDirectory"
echo "Destination Directory: $destinationDirectory"

# [TASK 3]

# [TASK 8]
seconds_per_day=$((24 * 60 * 60))
yesterdayTS=$(($currentTS - $seconds_per_day))

# Optional: Print yesterdayTS to verify
echo "Yesterday TS: $yesterdayTS"
```

Note on arrays
In the script, you will notice the line:

1
declare -a toBackup

Copied!
This line declares a variable called toBackup, which is an array. An array contains a list of values, and you can append items to arrays using the following syntax:

1
myArray+=($myVariable)

Copied!
When you print or echo an array, you will see its string representation, which is simply all of its values separated by spaces:

1
2
3
4
5
6
$ declare -a myArray
$ myArray+=("Linux")
$ myArray+=("is")
$ myArray+=("cool!")
$ echo ${myArray[@]}
Linux is cool!

Copied!
This will be useful later in the script where you will pass the array $toBackup, consisting of the names of all files that need to be backed up, to the tar command. This will archive all files at once!

### ASSISTANT

# üìå **Note on Arrays in Bash ‚Äì Understanding `toBackup`**

In this part of your script, you're working with **Bash arrays**, which are used to store and manage a **list of files** that need to be backed up.

This is a key step in building **dynamic and flexible backup logic** in your script.

---

## üîß What You‚Äôre Doing

### 1. Declare an array:

```bash
declare -a toBackup
```

- This creates an empty array named `toBackup`
- The `-a` flag tells Bash it‚Äôs an **indexed array**
- Using `declare` makes your script more readable and maintainable

---

### 2. Append items to the array:

```bash
toBackup+=("filename.txt")
```

You can also add variables:

```bash
toBackup+=("$file")
```

Each time this line runs, it adds one more file to the list.

---

### 3. Use the array in commands:

When you use `${toBackup[@]}`, it expands into all elements of the array as separate arguments:

```bash
tar -cvf archive.tar "${toBackup[@]}"
```

This becomes:

```bash
tar -cvf archive.tar "file1.txt" "file2.txt" "file3.txt"
```

Perfect for archiving multiple files dynamically!

## üß† Why Arrays Are Useful in Your Script

| Purpose             | How It Helps                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Store list of files | Collects only files modified in last 24 hours               |
| Pass dynamic lists  | Sends them directly to `tar` or other tools                 |
| Improve readability | Makes your code cleaner than using long command chains      |
| Enable flexibility  | Easily modify behavior later (e.g., filter by size or type) |

---

## üìù Example: Building an Array from File List

Here's how you might fill the array:

```bash
for file in *; do
    if [[ $(date -r "$file" +%s) -gt $yesterdayTS ]]; then
        toBackup+=("$file")
    fi
done
```

Then echo the contents:

```bash
echo "Files to back up:"
echo "${toBackup[@]}"
```

This loop checks each file‚Äôs modification timestamp and adds recent ones to the `toBackup` array.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Task                 | Syntax                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Declare array        | `declare -a array_name` |
| Add item to array    | `array_name+=("item")`  |
| Access all elements  | `${array_name[@]}`      |
| Use array in command | `"${array_name[@]}"`    |
| Print array contents | `echo ${array_name[@]}` |

---

## üí° Pro Tip

Always quote array expansions to handle filenames with spaces:

```bash
tar -cvf backup.tar "${toBackup[@]}"
```

Instead of:

```bash
tar -cvf backup.tar ${toBackup[@]}   # ‚ùå Risk of breaking on spaces
```

## üîπ **Task 13: Move the Backup File to the Destination Directory**

### Goal:

Move the generated `.tar.gz` file to the destination directory stored in `destAbsPath`.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
mv "$backupFileName" "$destAbsPath"
```

- `mv`: moves the file
- `"$backupFileName"`: the name of the backup file
- `"$destAbsPath"`: the full path where it should go

This ensures the backup ends up in the correct folder for safekeeping.

## ‚úÖ Final Code Snapshot (Tasks 12‚Äì13)

Here's what your script might now include:

```bash
# [TASK 12] Create compressed archive from toBackup array
tar -czvf "$backupFileName" "${toBackup[@]}"

# [TASK 13] Move backup to destination directory
mv "$backupFileName" "$destAbsPath"
```

You‚Äôve now built a script that:

- Accepts input directories via command-line arguments
- Captures current and past timestamps
- Finds recently modified files
- Builds a compressed backup
- Moves it to the target destination safely

### USER

Task 14
Save the current working file backup.sh with CTRL+s [Windows/Linux], CMD+s [MAC] or by navigating to File->Save as seen below:

Download the file to your local computer by navigating to File->Download as seen below:

You may save the file as backup.sh

You will later submit this file will for peer-grading.
Task 15
Open a new terminal by clicking on the menu bar and selecting Terminal->New Terminal, as in the image below:

This will open a new terminal at the bottom of the screen as seen below:

Save the backup.sh file you're working on and make it executable.
Click here for Hint
Use the chmod command with the correct options.

Verify the file is executable using the ls command with the -l option:
1
ls -l backup.sh

Copied!
Take a screenshot of the output of the command above and save it as 15-executable.jpg or .png.
Task 16
Download the following .zip file with the wget command:
1
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-LX0117EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Final%20Project/important-documents.zip

Copied!
Unzip the archive file:
1
unzip -DDo important-documents.zip

Copied!
Note: -DDo overwrites without restoring original modified date.

Update the file‚Äôs last-modified date to now:
1
touch important-documents/\*

Copied!
Test your script using the following command:
1
./backup.sh important-documents .

Copied!
This should have created a file called backup-[CURRENT_TIMESTAMP].tar.gz in your current directory.

Take a screenshot of the output of ls -l and save it as 16-backup-complete.jpg or .png.
Task 17
Copy the backup.sh script into the /usr/local/bin/ directory. (Do not use mv.)
Note: You may need to use sudo cp in order to create a file in /usr/local/bin/.

Test the cronjob to see if the backup script is getting triggered by scheduling it for every 1 minute.
Click here for Hint
1
_/1 _ \* \* \* /usr/local/bin/backup.sh /home/project/important-documents /home/project

Copied!
Please note that since the Theia Lab is a virtual environment, we need to explicitly start the cron service using the below command:
1
sudo service cron start

Copied!
Once the cron service is started, check in the directory /home/project to see if the .tar files are being created.

If they are, then stop the cron service using the below command, otherwise it will continue to create .tar files every minute:

1
sudo service cron stop

Copied!
Using crontab, schedule your /usr/local/bin/backup.sh script to backup the important-documents folder every 24 hours to the directory /home/project.

Take a screenshot of the output of crontab -l and save as 17-crontab.jpg or .png.

Tip: When you are setting up cron jobs in a real-life scenario, ensure the cron service is running, or start the cron service if needed.

### ASSISTANT

# üß∞ Final Project ‚Äì Tasks 14 to 17

## ‚úÖ Saving, Testing, and Scheduling Your Backup Script

In these final tasks, you:

- **Saved** your script for submission
- **Made it executable**
- **Tested it with sample files**
- **Scheduled it using `cron`**

These steps finalize your **Bash backup script project**, demonstrating real-world Linux scripting and automation skills.

---

## üîπ **Task 14: Save and Download `backup.sh`**

### Goal:

Save your script and download it for peer review submission.

### ‚úÖ Steps:

1. Save the file in Theia editor:

   - **Windows/Linux**: `CTRL + S`
   - **Mac**: `CMD + S`

2. Navigate to:

   - `File ‚Üí Save` (to confirm changes are saved)

3. Then download via:
   - `File ‚Üí Download`
   - Save as: `backup.sh` on your local machine

---

## üîπ **Task 15: Make `backup.sh` Executable**

### Goal:

Ensure your script can be run like a command (`./backup.sh`).

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
chmod u+x backup.sh
```

Or for all users:

```bash
chmod +x backup.sh
```

#### Verify permissions:

```bash
ls -l backup.sh
```

Expected output:

```
-rwxr--r-- 1 user group ... backup.sh
```

## üîπ **Task 16: Test Your Script**

### Step 1: Download and Extract Sample Files

```bash
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-LX0117EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Final%20Project/important-documents.zip
unzip -DDo important-documents.zip
touch important-documents/*
```

- `-DDo`: Unzips files and overwrites without preserving original modification time
- `touch`: Updates timestamps so files appear "recently modified"

### Step 2: Run Your Script

```bash
./backup.sh important-documents .
```

This should generate a file like:

```
backup-1717580000.tar.gz
```

Verify it was created:

```bash
ls -l
```

---

## üîπ **Task 17: Copy Script to `/usr/local/bin/` and Schedule It with Cron**

### Step 1: Move Script to System Path

```bash
sudo cp backup.sh /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
```

Use `sudo` if you get permission denied errors.

---

### Step 2: Start the Cron Service

Since this is a lab environment:

```bash
sudo service cron start
```

---

### Step 3: Edit Crontab and Schedule Your Script

Open crontab:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the following line to schedule daily backups:

```bash
0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh /home/project/important-documents /home/project
```

Or for testing every minute:

```bash
*/1 * * * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh /home/project/important-documents /home/project
```

After verifying that the script runs correctly, stop cron:

```bash
sudo service cron stop
```

To ensure no infinite backups are created.

---

### Step 4: Confirm Your Cron Job

List current jobs:

```bash
crontab -l
```

You should see:

```
*/1 * * * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh /home/project/important-documents /home/project
```

## üì¶ Final Notes

Your script now:

- Accepts two command-line arguments:
  - Target directory
  - Destination directory
- Finds files modified in the last 24 hours
- Archives them into a timestamped `.tar.gz` file
- Moves the archive to the destination
- Can be scheduled using `cron` for automated backups

---

## üß† Why This Matters

You've built a full **Linux automation pipeline**:

- Learned how to write scripts that accept input
- Used arrays and loops to manage dynamic data
- Created compressed archives
- Scheduled recurring tasks using `cron`

These are foundational skills used by:

- DevOps engineers
- System administrators
- Automation developers
- Data engineers
