description: How to create and SSH into an Amazon EC2 instance using Terraform ‚Äî completely within AWS Free Tier limits. We‚Äôll cover essential Terraform setup, defining AWS resources, adding a security group for SSH access, and outputting the public IP for easy login. Perfect for beginners looking to get hands-on with Infrastructure as Code (IaC)!
---

step-by-step to create a **Virtual Machine (EC2 instance)** on **AWS Free Tier** using **Terraform** and SSH to it.

---
####  Create a key pair in AWS Console (if you don‚Äôt have one)

* Go to: **AWS Console ‚Üí EC2 ‚Üí Key Pairs**
* Click **Create key pair**
* Name: `my-key`
* Type: RSA
* Save the `.pem` file (e.g., `my-key.pem`) securely

![aws key pair create](@/assets/images/aws-key-pair-pem.png)

#### Download and move it to your project Directory and Check Permissions of the `.pem` File
```bash
chmod 400 my-key.pem
```
---


### ‚úÖ Install Required Packages

#### 1. Install AWS CLI

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install awscli -y
```

Verify:

```bash
aws --version
```

#### 2. Install Terraform

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common curl
curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install terraform -y
```

Verify:

```bash
terraform -version
```

---

### ‚úÖ Configure AWS CLI

üí° Get access keys from:
**AWS Console > IAM > Users > Your Username > Security Credentials > Access Keys**

![terraform aws key](@/assets/images/terraform-aws-acess-key.png)

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter the following:

* AWS Access Key ID
* AWS Secret Access Key
* Region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
* Output format: Just press Enter

After this steps, two files are auto created inside **/home/username/.aws**

![aws config](@/assets/images/aws-terraform-cred-home.png)

---

### ‚úÖ  Create Terraform Configuration

#### 1. Create a folder

```bash
mkdir terraform-aws
cd terraform-aws
```

#### 2. Create `main.tf`

```bash
nano main.tf
```

Paste the following:

```hcl
# --------------------------------------------------
# Terraform block to specify required providers
# --------------------------------------------------
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"  # Using a stable version of AWS provider
    }
  }
}

# --------------------------------------------------
# AWS provider configuration
# --------------------------------------------------
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # AWS region to deploy resources
}

# --------------------------------------------------
# Data block to fetch default VPC (used by security group)
# --------------------------------------------------
data "aws_vpc" "default" {
  default = true
}

# --------------------------------------------------
# Security group resource to allow SSH access
# --------------------------------------------------
resource "aws_security_group" "ssh_access" {
  name        = "allow_ssh"
  description = "Allow SSH inbound traffic"
  vpc_id      = data.aws_vpc.default.id  # Attach to the default VPC

  # Inbound rule to allow SSH from any IP
  ingress {
    description = "SSH from anywhere"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # ‚ö†Ô∏è For production, replace with your IP (e.g. ["203.0.113.0/32"])
  }

  # Outbound rule to allow all traffic
  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# --------------------------------------------------
# EC2 instance resource
# --------------------------------------------------
resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0c2b8ca1dad447f8a"  # Amazon Linux 2 AMI (Free tier eligible)
  instance_type = "t2.micro"              # Free tier eligible instance type
  key_name      = "terraform-janak"       # Replace with the name of your existing AWS EC2 key pair
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.ssh_access.name]  # Attach the SSH security group

  tags = {
    Name = "MyTerraformVM"  # Tag to identify your instance
  }
}

# --------------------------------------------------
# Output block to show the public IP of the EC2 instance
# --------------------------------------------------
output "instance_public_ip" {
  description = "Public IP of the EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.my_ec2.public_ip
}

```

‚úÖ Save & close (`Ctrl + O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl + X`)

---

### ‚úÖ  Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

---

### ‚úÖ Code Formatting Terraform (optional)

```bash
terraform fmt
```

---

### ‚úÖ Validate Configuration

```bash
terraform validate
```

---

### ‚úÖ  Apply the Configuration

```bash
terraform apply
```

It will show you a plan. Type `yes` to proceed.


![terraform-apply](@/assets/images/terraform-apply-to-aws.png)

---

### ‚úÖ  Access Your EC2 Instance via SSH from your linxu machine.


   ```bash
    ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<public_ip>
   ```

üìù Use `ec2-user` for Amazon Linux AMI (or `ubuntu` if you switch to Ubuntu AMI).

![ssh to aws](@/assets/images/terraform-aws-ssh.png)
![aws](@/assets/images/aws-instance-terra.png)


### ‚úÖ Destroy the Instance 

```bash
terraform destroy
```


---


### ‚úÖ `terraform refresh` ‚Äî What It Does

```bash
terraform refresh
```

The `terraform refresh` command is used to:

> **Sync the Terraform state file with the actual current state of resources in your AWS (or other) infrastructure.**

In other words:
It checks what **exists in real AWS** and updates Terraform‚Äôs `.tfstate` file to reflect any changes that happened **outside of Terraform**.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.
