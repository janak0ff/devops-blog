Using an **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)**. For a production environment it is highly available, scalable, and fully managed load balancing solution.

### Architecture with AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB):

```
                                      Internet
                                         |
                                         |
                           Custom Domain (medical.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np)
                                         |
                                         V

                          (Listens on 80/443, distributes traffic)
                                         |
                                         | (Internal Network / Target Group)
                                         V
                         +-----------------------------------+
                         |                                   |
                  AWS EC2 Instance 1                  AWS EC2 Instance 2
                  (Private IP: 10.0.0.10)             (Private IP: 10.0.0.11)
                  [Dockerized PHP App on 8899]        [Dockerized PHP App on 8899]
                         |                                   |
                         V                                   V
                 (Docker containers)                 (Docker containers)
```

---

**Prerequisites:**

* All your backend EC2 instances are running the application (on localhost), accessible internally on port `8899` or `YOUR_PORT`
* All backend EC2 instances are in the same VPC. Ideally, they should be in multiple Availability Zones for higher availability.
* You have own your domain like- `janakkumarshrestha0.com.np`.

---

### Step-by-Step Guide for AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB):

### Step 1: Prepare Your Backend EC2 Instances

For **each** of your backend EC2 instances:

1.  **SSH into each instance:**
    ```bash
    ssh -i /path/to/your/key.pem admin@your_backend_ec2_public_ip
    ```
2.  **Ensure your application is running:**
    ```bash
    cd /home/ubuntu/your_project_dir # Your app directory
    docker-compose up -d # Ensure containers are running
    docker ps # Verify containers are running
    curl http://localhost:your_port # Verify app is accessible locally on your app's port
    ```
---

### Step 2: Configure Security Groups for Backend Instances

For **each** of your backend EC2 instances:

1.  Go to your **AWS EC2 Dashboard**.
2.  In the left navigation pane, click "Instances" and select one of your backend EC2 instances.
3.  In the "Security" tab, click on its associated **Security Group**.
4.  Click "Edit inbound rules".
5.  **Add a new rule:**
    * **Type:** Custom TCP
    * **Port range:** `8899` (Set Your own app's port).
    * **Source:** For now, you can temporarily set this to `0.0.0.0/0` for initial testing of the ALB setup (though not recommended for long-term). **However, the best practice is to restrict this.** Once you create your ALB's Security Group (in Step 3), you will **edit this rule again** and set the source to the **Security Group ID of your ALB**.
6. Make sure you have this four inbound rule:

### Step 3: Create an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)

1.  Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** in the AWS console.
2.  In the left navigation pane, under "Load Balancing," click on **Load Balancers**.
3.  Click **Create Load Balancer**.
4.  Choose **Application Load Balancer** and click **Create**.

5.  **Configure Load Balancer**
    * **Load balancer name:** `medical-app-alb` (or a name of your choice).
    * **Scheme:** `internet-facing`.
    * **IP address type:** `ipv4`.
    * **VPC:** Select the VPC where your backend EC2 instances reside.
    * **Availability Zones:** Select **all Availability Zones** (preferably all zones where your backend instances are located). This is crucial for ALB's high availability.

6.  **Configure Security Groups**
    * Default security group is fine or create new.
    * Click **Create a new security group**.
    * **Security group name:** `medical-alb-sg` (or a name of your choice).
    * **Description:** Allows HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the ALB.
    * **Inbound rules:**
        * Add a rule: **Type: HTTP, Port Range: 80, Source: 0.0.0.0/0**
        * Add a rule: **Type: HTTPS, Port Range: 443, Source: 0.0.0.0/0**
    * **Crucial:** Note down the **Security Group ID of this new ALB security group**. You will need it to update your backend instance security groups.

7.  **Configure Routing (Target Group)**
    * **Target group:** click **Create target group**.

![output](@/assets/images/Screenshot_20250627_142616.png)
    * **Target group name:** `medical-app-tg` (or a name of your choice).
    * **Target type:** `Instances`.
    * **Protocol:** `HTTP`.
    * **Port:** `80` (This is the port your app listens on internally on each EC2 instance).
    * Leave other option as default.
    * Click **Next**.

8.  **Register Targets**
    * Select all your **backend EC2 instances** from the "Available instances" list.
    * Ensure the **Port** listed for each instance is `8899`.
    * Click **Include as pending below**.
    * Click **Create Target Group**.

9.    * **Listeners and routing:**
        * By default, `HTTP: 80` will be listed.
        * select target group, click reload icon and select your target group.
        * Click **Add listener** and add `HTTPS: 443`.
        * Again select target group, click reload icon and select your target group.

10. * **Secure listener settings: SSL Certificate (for HTTPS: 443 Listener):**
        * Choose **From ACM (recommended)**.
        * If you don't already have an SSL certificate for your domain like `medical.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np` in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), click "Request a new ACM certificate" and follow the prompts to create a new Public Certificate. This usually involves DNS validation (adding a CNAME record to your DNS). **Follow this guide:** [Request a new ACM certificate]()
        * Once the certificate is issued in ACM or already have it, refresh and select it from the dropdown.
    * **Security Policy:** Stick with the default (or recommended).

11. **Review and Create Application Load Balancer**

![output](@/assets/images/Screenshot_20250627_143151.png)
    * Review all your settings carefully.
    * Click **Create load balancer**.


Wait a few minutes for the ALB to provision and become `active`. You can monitor its state in the Load Balancers section.

### Step 5: Add DNS Records (Route 53 Recommended)

1.  Once your ALB shows as `active`, go back to the **Load Balancers** section in the EC2 Dashboard.
2.  Select your newly created ALB.

![output](@/assets/images/Screenshot_20250627_150532.png)

3.  Copy its **DNS name** (it will look something like `medical-app-alb-41267975.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`).

![output](@/assets/images/Screenshot_20250627_151554.png)

4.  * **Type:** `CNAME`
    * **Name:** `medical`
    * **Target:** `medical-app-alb-41267975.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`
    * Save changes.

---

### Step 6: Test Your Application

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `https://medical.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np`.
2.  Your ALB should now be distributing traffic to your healthy backend instances.

![output](@/assets/images/Screenshot_20250627_151843.png)

3.  To confirm load balancing, you can temporarily modify your `index.php` (Heading) on *each* backend server to display a unique heading identifier. Then, refresh the browser multiple times. You should see the heading change, indicating that the ALB is distributing requests.

4. Refreshing:

5. Refreshing:
![output](@/assets/images/Screenshot_20250627_152124.png)

6.  **Remember to remove these temporary heading identifiers** once you've confirmed load balancing.
