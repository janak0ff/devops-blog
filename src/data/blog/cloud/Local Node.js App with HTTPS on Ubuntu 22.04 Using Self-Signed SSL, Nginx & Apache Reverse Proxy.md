# Quick 1-paragraph summary (follow this if you want just the steps)

1. Create cert+key with OpenSSL (with SAN), store as `/etc/ssl/private/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.key` and `/etc/ssl/certs/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt`.
2. Add `127.0.0.1 nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np` to `/etc/hosts`.
3. Configure Nginx (or Apache) to listen on HTTPS `443`, using the cert and reverse proxying to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. Enable and reload service.
4. Optionally add the cert to OS trust (`/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/...` + `sudo update-ca-certificates`) or use `mkcert` to generate trusted local certs.
   (Full commands & file contents below with explanations.)

# Environment assumptions

* Ubuntu **22.04 LTS** 
* Node app running locally at `http://localhost:3000` (or `http://127.0.0.1:3000`). If your app binds to another address, update proxy_pass to match.
* You will run commands in a terminal. All commands that need elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`.

# 1 — Create a self-signed certificate (with Subject Alternative Name)

Modern browsers require SAN (Subject Alternative Name). We'll create a small OpenSSL config file that includes SAN and then generate a 2048-bit key + certificate valid for 1 year.

1. Create a temp openssl config file `~/nodejs-openssl.cnf` with SAN:

```bash
cat > ~/nodejs-openssl.cnf <<'EOF'
[ req ]
default_bits       = 2048
prompt             = no
default_md         = sha256
req_extensions     = req_ext
distinguished_name = dn

[ dn ]
C  = NP
ST = Bagmati
L  = Kathmandu
O  = Personal
CN = nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np

[ req_ext ]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[ alt_names ]
DNS.1 = nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np
DNS.2 = localhost
IP.1  = 127.0.0.1

[ v3_ext ]
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names
EOF
```

Explanation:

* `CN` is the Common Name (fallback). Modern TLS relies on SAN; we include `subjectAltName` under `[alt_names]` to avoid browser warnings.
* `DNS.1` is the hostname, `DNS.2` localhost, `IP.1` 127.0.0.1 so cert works with both name and IP tests.

2. Generate private key and certificate (valid 365 days):

```bash
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 \
  -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout /tmp/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.key \
  -out /tmp/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt \
  -config ~/nodejs-openssl.cnf \
  -extensions v3_ext
```

Explanation:

* `openssl req -x509` creates a self-signed certificate (X.509).
* `-nodes` means “no DES” — do not encrypt the private key with a passphrase (so services like nginx/apache can read it without interactive password).
* `-days 365` makes cert valid for 365 days.
* `-newkey rsa:2048` creates a new 2048-bit RSA key.
* `-keyout` and `-out` set temporary output paths.
* `-config` uses the config file we created with SAN.
* `-extensions v3_ext` ensures v3 extensions (including SAN) are added.

---

# 2 — Store cert and key in safe paths with correct permissions

We'll move certs to canonical locations and set safe permissions.

1. Create directories (if not exist) and move files:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssl/private
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssl/certs
sudo mv /tmp/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.key /tmp/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt /etc/ssl/private/
# Move certificate to certs for clarity:
sudo mv /etc/ssl/private/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt /etc/ssl/certs/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt
sudo mv /etc/ssl/private/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.key /etc/ssl/private/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.key
```

Note: we moved the certificate to `/etc/ssl/certs` and kept the key in `/etc/ssl/private`.

2. Set permissions:

```bash
# Certificate readable by everyone
sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssl/certs/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt
sudo chown root:root /etc/ssl/certs/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt

# Private key only readable by root (600)
sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssl/private/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.key
sudo chown root:root /etc/ssl/private/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.key
```

Explanation:

* Certificates are public; `644` (owner read/write, group/world read) is fine.
* Private keys are sensitive — `600` ensures only `root` can read/write. Nginx/Apache running as root initially reads the key then drops privileges; keeping key limited to root reduces risk if non-root access exists.

# 3 — Make `nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np` resolve locally

Edit `/etc/hosts` so that the hostname resolves to your machine (loopback). Add this single exact line.

1. Add the line:

```bash
# Backup hosts first
sudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.bak

# Add mapping (this is the exact line to add)
echo '127.0.0.1 nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Exact line to add (copy/paste into `/etc/hosts` if you prefer a text editor):

```
127.0.0.1 nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np
```

Explanation:

* `/etc/hosts` maps names to IPs locally — this makes your OS resolve the hostname to the local loopback without any DNS lookup.

---

# 4 — Full Nginx configuration (HTTPS reverse proxy to localhost:3000)

We'll create a server block file, enable it, test, and reload.

1. Install Nginx if you don't have it:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nginx
```

2. Create Nginx site file at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np`:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/nginx/sites-available/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np > /dev/null <<'EOF'
# /etc/nginx/sites-available/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np
server {
    # Listen on IPv4 and IPv6, HTTPS
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;

    # Your hostname
    server_name nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np;

    # Paths to certificate and private key
    ssl_certificate     /etc/ssl/certs/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.key;

    # SSL settings (basic, modern safe defaults)
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
    ssl_session_timeout 10m;

    # Proxy settings
    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:3000/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        # Preserve the original Host header (so your app sees requested host)
        proxy_set_header   Host $host;

        # Forward real client IPs
        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

        # Indicate the original protocol used by client
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # WebSocket support
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection $connection_upgrade;
    }
}

# Optional HTTP -> HTTPS redirect
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np;

    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
EOF
```

Explanation of important directives:

* `listen 443 ssl;` — tells nginx to accept HTTPS on port 443.
* `server_name` — hostname this server block responds to.
* `ssl_certificate` / `ssl_certificate_key` — paths to the cert and key we created.
* `ssl_protocols` — which TLS versions to allow; we enable TLS 1.2 and 1.3.
* `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000/;` — forwards requests to your Node app.
* `proxy_set_header Host $host;` — preserves Host header (your app sees requested hostname).
* `X-Real-IP`, `X-Forwarded-For` — pass client IP info to backend (useful for logging).
* `Upgrade` & `Connection` headers — required to proxy WebSockets.

3. Create the `$connection_upgrade` variable so Connection header is correct (some nginx versions require):

Append this to file above `http` block? If using default Ubuntu nginx, you can set inside the server block — but simpler: add this at top of the same file (just before first `server {`):

We already used `$connection_upgrade` — some nginx configurations require setting:

```bash
# (Only if you get "unknown variable $connection_upgrade" errors)
# Add the following line near the top of /etc/nginx/nginx.conf within 'http { ... }'
# Or you can add a fast workaround at top of this site file:
sudo sed -n '1,1p' /etc/nginx/sites-available/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np >/dev/null || true
```

(Usually modern nginx supports `$connection_upgrade` mapping via `map` in global `nginx.conf`. If you see errors, use the troubleshooting section below.)


#### 🧱 Fixing the “unknown `$connection_upgrade` variable” Error

If you see:

```
unknown "connection_upgrade" variable
```

edit `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` and inside the `http { ... }` block (before any `server {}`) add:

```nginx
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    '' close;
}
```


4. Enable site and reload Nginx:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Explanation:

* `ln -s ... sites-enabled` enables the site (Ubuntu loads files from `sites-enabled`).
* `nginx -t` tests configuration syntax.
* `systemctl reload nginx` reloads configuration without dropping connections.

5. Permissions (already discussed): ensure `/etc/ssl/private/...key` is `600` root:root so only root reads it.

---

# 5 — Full Apache configuration (HTTPS reverse proxy)

If you prefer Apache instead of Nginx, here’s a complete Apache VirtualHost.

1. Install Apache if you don't have it:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apache2
```

2. Enable required Apache modules:

```bash
sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
sudo a2enmod headers
sudo a2enmod remoteip
```

Explanation:

* `ssl` — enables TLS support.
* `proxy` and `proxy_http` — enable reverse proxy to HTTP backend.
* `headers` — useful for setting headers.
* `remoteip` — optional, allow Apache to modify the perceived remote IP (if behind another proxy).

3. Create the Apache site file `/etc/apache2/sites-available/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.conf` with full content:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/apache2/sites-available/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.conf > /dev/null <<'EOF'
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np

    # Path to the certificate and key
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile    /etc/ssl/certs/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.key

    # Optional SSL settings for stronger security
    SSLProtocol             all -SSLv3 -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1
    SSLOptions              +StrictRequire
    # SSLHonorCipherOrder     on
    # SSLCipherSuite         HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5

    # Preserve original host header
    ProxyPreserveHost On

    # Proxy pass everything to the Node app
    ProxyPass        / http://127.0.0.1:3000/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:3000/

    # Forward client IP to backend
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port "443"

    # Logging (optional)
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/nodejs-error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/nodejs-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>

# Optional: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np
    Redirect permanent / https://nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np/
</VirtualHost>
EOF
```

Explanation:

* `<VirtualHost *:443>` — listens on port 443 for HTTPS.
* `SSLEngine on` — enables SSL for this virtual host.
* `SSLCertificateFile` / `SSLCertificateKeyFile` — point to the files we installed.
* `ProxyPass` / `ProxyPassReverse` — forward requests to backend `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`. `ProxyPassReverse` changes response headers that refer to backend URLs so redirects work.
* `ProxyPreserveHost On` — preserves incoming Host header for backend.
* `RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto` — tell backend the request came in via HTTPS.

4. Enable site and reload Apache:

```bash
sudo a2ensite nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.conf
sudo apache2ctl configtest
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

Explanation:

* `a2ensite` creates symlink in `sites-enabled`.
* `apache2ctl configtest` checks syntax.
* `systemctl reload apache2` applies new config.

---

# 6 — Testing the setup

## 6.1 Basic curl (browser & CLI)

Because you added `/etc/hosts`, the name resolves to 127.0.0.1.

1. Quick insecure test with `curl` (ignores TLS trust checks):

```bash
curl -v --insecure https://nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np/
```

Explanation:

* `-v` verbose: shows TLS handshake and headers.
* `--insecure` tells curl not to validate the certificate with a CA. Useful for initial check if server serves TLS correctly.

2. Test **without** `--insecure` (after you add cert to system trust — explained below):

```bash
curl -v https://nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np/
```

If trust is not added yet, curl will report `SSL: certificate subject name` or `self signed certificate` errors.

## 6.2 Check certificate with `openssl s_client`

```bash
openssl s_client -connect nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np:443 -servername nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np
```

Explanation:

* `-connect host:port` opens TLS connection.
* `-servername` sets SNI (Server Name Indication) so the server returns the certificate for that name.
* Output shows certificate chain, subject, issuer, expiry dates, and certificate content.

## 6.3 Browser behavior & trusting the cert

### Quick local trust (systemwide, Ubuntu)

Add the certificate as a trusted CA certificate (works for most system apps and Chrome/Chromium; Firefox uses its NSS store—instructions below):

1. Copy cert to local CA folder and update trust:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/ssl/certs/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

Explanation:

* `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` is where local CA certs can be added. `update-ca-certificates` installs them in system trust store used by OpenSSL and Chromium/Chrome (on Ubuntu) after restart.

2. Restart browser (Chrome/Chromium) and try visiting `https://nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np/` — Chrome should accept it.

### Firefox (uses its own NSS DB)

Firefox does not use the system trust store by default. Use `certutil` (from `libnss3-tools`) to add cert to your Firefox profile:

1. Install `libnss3-tools` if not present:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libnss3-tools
```

2. Find your Firefox profile (example command):

```bash
ls ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default-release || ls ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default || true
```

Pick the profile folder returned, for example: `~/.mozilla/firefox/abcd1234.default-release`.

3. Import the certificate into that profile's cert DB:

```bash
# Replace PROFILE_DIR with the actual directory returned above
PROFILE_DIR=$(ls -d ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default-release 2>/dev/null || ls -d ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default 2>/dev/null)
certutil -d sql:$PROFILE_DIR -A -t "TCu,Cu,Tu" -n "Local nodejs cert" -i /etc/ssl/certs/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt
```

Explanation:

* `certutil -A` adds a trusted certificate.
* `-t "TCu,Cu,Tu"` sets trust flags: trusted CA for issuing websites and email. (Beginners: just run command; if it fails, confirm profile path.)

### Alternative: use `mkcert` to avoid manual trust steps (recommended for local development)

`mkcert` creates a local CA and automatically trusts it in system/NSS stores, making locally-issued certs trusted by browsers without warnings.

Install `mkcert` and use:

```bash
# Install prerequisites and mkcert (typical approach)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libnss3-tools
# Install mkcert via snap (snap is commonly available)
sudo snap install mkcert --classic

# Create and install a local CA (only once)
mkcert -install

# Generate certs for the hostname and localhost
mkcert nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1

# mkcert produces files like:
# nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np+2.pem  (cert)
# nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np+2-key.pem (key)
# Move them to /etc/ssl if desired:
sudo mv nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np+2.pem /etc/ssl/certs/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt
sudo mv nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np+2-key.pem /etc/ssl/private/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.key
sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssl/private/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.key
sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssl/certs/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt
```

Explanation:

* `mkcert -install` installs a local CA and trusts it in system and Firefox stores (so generated certs will not trigger browser warnings).
* `mkcert hostname` generates a cert and key for the hostname and automatically trusted. `snap install mkcert --classic` is a typical install route — if `snap` is not available, refer to mkcert docs.

# 7 — Troubleshooting tips (common problems & fixes)

**1 `nginx -t` fails / nginx refuses to reload**

* Run `sudo nginx -t` to test; fix syntax errors indicated by the test. Example:

  * Unknown directive / missing semicolon — open the file and check lines.
* Check logs: `sudo journalctl -u nginx --no-pager --since "10 minutes ago"` and `/var/log/nginx/error.log`.

**2 `apache2ctl configtest` fails**

* `sudo apache2ctl configtest` prints reason; common issues are missing modules. Ensure `proxy`, `proxy_http`, `ssl` are enabled (`sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http ssl`).

**3 Port conflicts (another service listening on 443)**

* Check who is listening: `sudo ss -tulpn | grep :443` or `sudo lsof -i :443`.
* If Apache is running and you want Nginx, stop/disable conflicting service: `sudo systemctl stop apache2` / `sudo systemctl disable apache2`. Or pick one server to use and disable the other.

**4 Firewall (ufw) blocking connections**

* Check `sudo ufw status`. To allow HTTPS locally:

  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
  sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
  ```
* Note: On a strictly local dev machine you may not need firewall changes if you connect from the same machine, but for remote access they are required.

**5 SELinux**

* Ubuntu uses AppArmor rather than SELinux by default. If you run this on RHEL/CentOS/Fedora with SELinux enabled, ensure contexts for `/etc/ssl/private` are `httpd_config_t` or use `restorecon` as appropriate. For Ubuntu, usually not applicable.

**6 `unknown variable $connection_upgrade` or WebSocket issues**

* For WebSocket proxying in nginx, ensure you include:

  ```nginx
  map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
      default upgrade;
      ''      close;
  }
  ```

  in `http { ... }` section of `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. If you don’t want to edit nginx.conf, use:

  ```nginx
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  ```

  instead of `$connection_upgrade`.

**7 Backend logs — 502 / 504 errors**

* Check Node app is running and listening on `127.0.0.1:3000`:

  ```bash
  ss -tulpn | grep 3000
  # or
  sudo lsof -i :3000
  ```
* Check app logs — the app might have crashed.

---

# 8 — Security note (self-signed certs vs production)

* **Self-signed certs** are fine for local development, but they are not trusted by browsers or other systems by default. They do not prove identity and are vulnerable to spoofing if used across networks.
* **Production recommendation:** Use a trusted CA such as **Let’s Encrypt** for public sites. For automated issuance on servers reachable from the internet, Let’s Encrypt’s `certbot` with HTTP validation is common. For domains whose public DNS you control but are not web-accessible, use Let’s Encrypt DNS challenge (API-based) to prove domain control.
* For local development, **mkcert** is much easier — it creates a local CA and auto-trusts it on your machine so browsers stop complaining. For anything public-facing, use a real CA.

---

# 9 — One-page checklist / step order you can run

1. Create the openssl config `~/nodejs-openssl.cnf` (copy from step 1).
2. Run the `openssl req -x509 ...` command to create cert & key (step 1).
3. Move cert/key to `/etc/ssl/certs` and `/etc/ssl/private` and set permissions (step 2).
4. Add `127.0.0.1 nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np` to `/etc/hosts` (step 3).
5. Install Nginx or Apache and create the config file(s) exactly as shown (steps 4 & 5).
6. Enable site and reload `nginx` or `apache2` and test with `curl` and `openssl s_client` (step 6).
7. Optionally add cert to system trust (`/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/...` + `sudo update-ca-certificates`) or use `mkcert`.
8. Troubleshoot using the commands in step 7.

# Appendix — exact files & commands in one place (copy/paste friendly)

### OpenSSL config (create once)

```bash
cat > ~/nodejs-openssl.cnf <<'EOF'
[ req ]
default_bits       = 2048
prompt             = no
default_md         = sha256
req_extensions     = req_ext
distinguished_name = dn

[ dn ]
C  = NP
ST = Bagmati
L  = Kathmandu
O  = Personal
CN = nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np

[ req_ext ]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[ alt_names ]
DNS.1 = nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np
DNS.2 = localhost
IP.1  = 127.0.0.1

[ v3_ext ]
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names
EOF
```

### Generate cert & key

```bash
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 \
  -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout /tmp/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.key \
  -out /tmp/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt \
  -config ~/nodejs-openssl.cnf \
  -extensions v3_ext
```

### Move to final paths + permissions

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssl/private /etc/ssl/certs
sudo mv /tmp/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt /etc/ssl/certs/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt
sudo mv /tmp/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.key /etc/ssl/private/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.key
sudo chown root:root /etc/ssl/certs/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt /etc/ssl/private/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.key
sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssl/certs/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt
sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssl/private/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.key
```

### /etc/hosts (exact line)

```text
127.0.0.1 nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np
```

Add it with:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.bak
echo '127.0.0.1 nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

### Full Nginx file (exact path)

`/etc/nginx/sites-available/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np`
(Use the same content as shown previously in Step 4; you can create it with:)

```bash
sudo tee /etc/nginx/sites-available/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np > /dev/null <<'EOF'
# (paste the Nginx server block content from earlier)
EOF
```

Enable + reload:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Full Apache file (exact path)

`/etc/apache2/sites-available/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.conf`
(Use the same content as shown previously in Step 5; create with:)

```bash
sudo tee /etc/apache2/sites-available/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.conf > /dev/null <<'EOF'
# (paste the Apache VirtualHost content from earlier)
EOF
```

Enable and reload Apache:

```bash
sudo a2enmod ssl proxy proxy_http headers
sudo a2ensite nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.conf
sudo apache2ctl configtest
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

### Quick tests

```bash
# Test HTTPS with curl (insecure)
curl -v --insecure https://nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np/

# Test HTTPS with openssl (SNI)
openssl s_client -connect nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np:443 -servername nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np
```

### Add cert to system trust (Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo cp /etc/ssl/certs/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates
# Restart browser after this
```

### mkcert option (recommended for local dev)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libnss3-tools
sudo snap install mkcert --classic
mkcert -install
mkcert nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
# Move mkcert outputs to /etc/ssl paths if desired, then set permissions
```


## 🧭 One-Paragraph Summary

To enable HTTPS for a local Node.js app on Ubuntu 22.04:
map your custom domain in `/etc/hosts`, generate a self-signed certificate with OpenSSL, store it under `/etc/ssl/`, configure Nginx or Apache as a reverse proxy with SSL, test using `curl -vk`, and add the certificate to your local trust store (or use `mkcert`).
For production, replace the self-signed certificate with a Let’s Encrypt-issued one.

<!-- my prompt
I have a Node.js app running locally at http://localhost:3000 on Ubuntu (specify if you need a particular Ubuntu version; I’m using Ubuntu 22.04). I want to access it in my local browser as:

    https://nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np/

Please provide a beginner-friendly, step-by-step guide that includes **every command and full file contents** I need to run or create, and a clear explanation of what each command and configuration line does.

Requirements:
1. Create a self-signed SSL certificate suitable for the hostname nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np and explain the OpenSSL commands used.
2. Configure the system so that the hostname nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np resolves to my local machine (explain editing /etc/hosts, and show the exact line to add).
3. Provide **complete** Nginx configuration (server block) that acts as an HTTPS reverse proxy to http://localhost:3000, including:
   - exact file path(s) to create (e.g., /etc/nginx/sites-available/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np),
   - commands to enable the site and reload Nginx,
   - permission/ownership commands if needed,
   - explanations for each directive used (listen, server_name, ssl_certificate, proxy_pass, proxy_set_header, etc.).
4. Provide **complete** Apache configuration (VirtualHost) that acts as an HTTPS reverse proxy to http://localhost:3000, including:
   - exact file path(s) to create (e.g., /etc/apache2/sites-available/nodejs.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np.conf),
   - commands to enable required modules and the site, and to reload Apache,
   - explanations for each directive used (SSLEngine, SSLCertificateFile, ProxyPass, ProxyPassReverse, etc.).
5. Show how to create and store the self-signed cert and private key in a safe path (e.g., /etc/ssl/private and /etc/ssl/certs), with correct permissions and explain why those permissions are used.
6. Show how to test the setup:
   - curl commands (including one to test HTTPS and show verbose output),
   - how to check certificates with `openssl s_client`,
   - what to expect in the browser and how to add the self-signed cert to the OS/browser trust store (both a quick local trust method and an alternative using `mkcert` to avoid browser warnings).
7. Include troubleshooting tips for common problems (Nginx/Apache failing to reload, port conflicts, firewall issues like ufw, SELinux notes if applicable).
8. Add a short security note explaining the risks of self-signed certs and the recommended production approach (Let’s Encrypt with DNS validation) and a one-paragraph summary of steps so I can follow quickly.
9. Assume nothing: show `sudo` where necessary, and prefix each shell command with the command to run it (don't skip `sudo` when needed). Use explicit file contents in fenced code blocks. Use numbered steps, and keep the language beginner-friendly.

Do not execute anything for me; only provide the full commands and file contents and explanations so I can run them on my Ubuntu machine.
