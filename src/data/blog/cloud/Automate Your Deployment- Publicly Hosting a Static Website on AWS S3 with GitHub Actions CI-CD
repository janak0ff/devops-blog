## Automate Your Deployment: Publicly Hosting a Static Website on AWS S3 with GitHub Actions CI/CD 

Deploying a website shouldn't be a tedious manual task. By setting up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using **GitHub Actions** and **AWS S3**, you can automate the entire process, pushing changes live whenever you commit code.

-----

## Step 1: Your Project Structure and Repository Setup

Your project is structured cleanly with all website files located in the root directory. This simplifies the deployment command.

## Step 2: Configure AWS S3 for Static Hosting

We need a destination for your website files and a policy that grants public access.

1.  **Create an S3 Bucket:** Create a new S3 bucket (e.g., `demo-cicd-janak`). Choose a region (e.g., `us-east-1`).
2.  **Enable Static Website Hosting:**
      * Go to the bucket's **Properties** tab.
      * Under **Static website hosting**, choose **Enable**.
      * Set both **Index document** and **Error document** to `index.html` (or your preferred file).
3.  **Set Bucket Policy (Grant Public Read Access) using the AWS Policy Generator:**
      * Navigate to the **AWS Policy Generator** tool online.
      * **Type of Policy:** `S3 Bucket Policy`
      * **Effect:** `Allow`
      * **Principal:** `*` (Public access)
      * **AWS Service:** `Amazon S3`
      * **Actions:** Select `GetObject` (`s3:GetObject`)
      * **Amazon Resource Name (ARN):** Enter the ARN for all objects in your bucket: `arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*`
      * Click **Add Statement**, then **Generate Policy**.
      * Copy the generated JSON code and paste it into the **Permissions** tab \> **Bucket policy** section of your S3 bucket.

> **CRITICAL:** Ensure the "Block public access (bucket settings)" is turned **OFF** for your bucket to be publicly accessible.

-----

## Step 3: Secure GitHub with AWS Credentials

We will use **GitHub Secrets** to securely store your AWS Access Keys, allowing the workflow to authenticate.

1.  **Create IAM Credentials:** In your AWS account, create a dedicated **IAM User** with programmatic access. Attach a policy granting `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, `s3:DeleteObject`, and `s3:ListBucket` permissions limited to your deployment bucket.
2.  **Add Secrets to GitHub:**
      * Navigate to your GitHub Repository **Settings**.
      * Go to **Secrets and variables** \> **Actions**.
      * Add two new repository secrets:
          * **Name:** `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
          * **Value:** *(Your IAM Access Key ID)*
          * **Name:** `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
          * **Value:** *(Your IAM Secret Access Key)*

## Step 4: Create the CI/CD Workflow (`main.yml`)

The workflow file lives at **`.github/workflows/main.yml`**. This YAML configuration defines the steps to deploy your repository's content to S3. We use the latest action versions to avoid deprecation warnings.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/main.yml

name: Deploy Static Website to S3

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main 

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository code
        # Use the latest stable version
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 

      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        # Use the latest stable version
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4 
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          # IMPORTANT: Use the region where your S3 bucket is located
          aws-region: us-east-1 

      - name: Deploy root files to S3 bucket
        # Sync the entire root directory ('.') to the S3 bucket
        run: aws s3 sync . s3://YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME --delete
```

>  **Sync Command Explained:**
> `aws s3 sync . s3://YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME --delete`
>
>   * The dot (`.`) represents the root of your checked-out repository, deploying files like `index.html` directly to the S3 root.
>   * `--delete` ensures that files you remove from Git are also deleted from your live S3 bucket.

## Step 5: Push and Monitor the Deployment

Commit and push your new `.github/workflows/main.yml` file to the `main` branch.

1.  Open your terminal in the project root:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow"
    git push -u origin main
    ```
2.  Go to your GitHub repository and click the **Actions** tab. You will see the **`Deploy Static Website to S3`** workflow running.

3.  Once the workflow status turns green (Success), go to your S3 bucket's **Properties** and click the **Endpoint URL** under Static website hosting.

Your static website is now live\! Every subsequent `git push` will automatically trigger this pipeline, keeping your site perpetually synchronized.
