---

## 💻 Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

  * A **Cloudflare account**.
  * A **domain name** added to your Cloudflare account and using Cloudflare's nameservers.
  * **SSH server running** on your local PC (e.g., OpenSSH on Linux/macOS, or an SSH server on Windows) on the default port **22** (or your custom port).
  * On my local/host server firewall is inactive, if you have enable then add rules for tcp(22,3389 and 3000) ports.
  * Running Node app locally on 3000 port.


# I am gonna do ssh, access remote desktop (RDP) and access localhost:3000 app on my local pc form anywhere on internet (different network).

#### what is Cloudflare Tunnel?
Cloudflare Tunnel is a secure way to connect your local server or device to the internet through Cloudflare without exposing your IP address or opening ports. It creates an outbound-only encrypted connection from your server to Cloudflare, which then safely routes internet traffic to your server. This improves security by keeping your server hidden behind a firewall and simplifies remote access without complex network setups.​

-----

The Host Machine is your local PC that you want to access remotely.

## HOST/CLIENT : Install Cloudflare Tunnel (`cloudflared`) on both local/host server and clients linux PCs

The `cloudflared` daemon is the service that creates the secure tunnel.

1.  **Download and Install:** Use the appropriate package manager for your Linux distribution (e.g., Debian/Ubuntu): On the Host Machine
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
    which cloudflared
    ```

  - Confirm the cloudflared installation path - `/usr/local/bin/cloudflared` if different customize you path in config file.


## HOST: Install and Verify Services (SSH & RDP) on you local/host server

We must ensure the services are installed and listening locally before the tunnel can expose them.

#### OpenSSH Server

   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openssh-server -y
   sudo systemctl enable --now ssh
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   sudo systemctl status ssh 
   ```

#### XRDP - for remote desktop access

   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install xrdp -y
   sudo adduser xrdp ssl-cert
   sudo systemctl enable --now xrdp
   sudo systemctl status xrdp
   ```

This will set up SSH server for remote terminal access on port 22 and xrdp for remote desktop protocol (RDP) access on port 3389 on your linux machine. Both services will be enabled to start automatically on system boot.|

Run the following command to check the service on specifed port.

```bash
sudo ss -tuln | grep -E ':22 |:3389 |:3000 '
sudo ss -tuln | grep 22
```


## HOST: Create the Named Tunnel and Configuration

1.  **Authenticate Cloudflared:**
    This opens a browser. Log in to your Cloudflare account, authorize and save cert.pem.
    ```bash
    cloudflared tunnel login
    ```
2.  **Create a new tunnel. You can name it whatever you like (`remote-acc`):**
    ```bash
    cloudflared tunnel create remote-acc
    ```
   This generates your UUID (tunnel ID) (e.g., bbfb870f-c972-...) and JSON credentials inside /home/USERNAME/.cloudflared/.



3.  **Create/Edit `config.yml`:** Define the hostnames and the services they map to. Use your own domain name
    ```bash
    nano ~/.cloudflared/config.yml
    ```
   
    ```yaml
    #tunnel: YOUR_TUNNEL_ID
    tunnel: bbfb870f-c972-4653-97af-41667bd5cb71  # Your Tunnel UUID
    #credentials-file: /home/YOUR_USERNAME/.cloudflared/YOUR_TUNNEL_ID.json
    credentials-file: /home/janak/.cloudflared/bbfb870f-c972-4653-97af-41667bd5cb71.json # Give path acccording to yours  
    ingress:
      - hostname: ssh.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np # for ssh server
        service: ssh://localhost:22
      - hostname: desktop.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np # For remote desktop
        service: tcp://localhost:3389    
      - hostname: localnode.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np # For node app
        service: http://localhost:3000
      #If you have any other services on local host, go on like this...
      - service: http_status:404
    ```

----

## HOST: DNS Configuration - **Create DNS Records (Cloudflare)** 

You need to tell Cloudflare to route traffic from your chosen hostname to the tunnel. Use your own tunnel and domain name

```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns remote-acc ssh.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np
cloudflared tunnel route dns remote-acc desktop.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np
cloudflared tunnel route dns remote-acc localnode.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np
```
This command automatically creates the correct CNAME record in your Cloudflare DNS, pointing your all hostname to the tunnel named remote-acc.

----

## HOST: Run the Tunnel
Start the tunnel service so it can connect to the Cloudflare network and begin listening for traffic: Replace with your tunnel name

  ```bash
  cloudflared tunnel run remote-acc
  ```

  * Keep this process running, as it maintains the connection between your local PC and the Cloudflare edge.
  * We"ll discuss later to run tunnel on background, Permanent/auto start on boot as a demon service.

----

## CLIENT : After you run the cloudflared tunnel the you can immedaiately 
Access your node app running on 3000 port is accessible form the internet / any networks
```
localnode.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np
```

----

## CLIENT : Configuration the SSH Client (Client Machine on any network)

On the PC you're connecting **from** (your remote client or there pc on different networks), you need to install `cloudflared` and configure your SSH client to use it as a proxy.

 **Edit your SSH configuration file** (on Linux/macOS, or a similar configuration on Windows tools like PuTTY).
1.  **Edit `~/.ssh/config`:**
    ```bash
    nano ~/.ssh/config
    ```
2.  **Add SSH Configuration:**
    ```ini
    Host remote-acc-janak # Give host name you like
      Hostname ssh.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np   # Replace with you actual host name.
      # The key line that uses cloudflared to proxy the connection and adjust path if different
      ProxyCommand /usr/local/bin/cloudflared access ssh --hostname %h
      # Replace with the username on the local server / host machine.
      User jack  

      # (Optional) Use a specific port if your server isn't on default port, otherwise, this line isn't necessary
      # Port 22
    ```
    * The `ProxyCommand` tells the SSH client to route the connection through `cloudflared`, which handles the tunnel authentication.
    
    Note: Make sure the path to cloudflared (`/usr/local/bin/cloudflared`) is correct for your client machine's installation. Check using this command `which cloudflared` and match.

3.  **Connect via SSH**

You can now connect to your local PC from anywhere on the internet using the simplified SSH command from the client machine:

```bash
ssh remote-acc-janak
# or
ssh -vvv remote-acc-janak # for more details
```

  * The first time, you may be prompted to authenticate with Cloudflare Access (e.g., a browser login). After that, you will be prompted for your local PC's SSH password or key.

----

## CLIENT: SSH connect directly using a single command without having to rely on the configuration block in your `~/.ssh/config` file.

To connect directly while still using the Cloudflare Tunnel as a proxy, you need to embed the `ProxyCommand` directly into the `ssh` command using the **`-o` (Option)** flag.

Here is the format you would use:

```bash
ssh jack@ssh.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np \
    -o ProxyCommand="/usr/local/bin/cloudflared access ssh --hostname %h"
```

- Breakdown of the Command

| Part of Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ssh jack@...` | Specifies the user (`jack`) and the destination host (`ssh.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np`). |
| `-o ProxyCommand="..."` | The `-o` flag overrides or sets an option usually found in `~/.ssh/config`. |
| `"/usr/local/bin/cloudflared access ssh --hostname %h"` | This is the command that initiates the tunnel connection. |
| `%h` | This is a placeholder that is replaced by the actual hostname (`ssh.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np`) at runtime. |

- Alternative: Simplify the Command

If you want to make this long command easier to type repeatedly without using your `~/.ssh/config` file, you could create a **shell alias** in your shell startup file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):
-  Run this command to add alias and reload `.bashrc`
```bash
echo "alias remote-acc='ssh jack@ssh.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np -o ProxyCommand=\"/usr/local/bin/cloudflared access ssh --hostname %h\"'" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, you could simply type:

```bash
remote-acc
```

----

## CLIENT: Stronger Authentication (SSH Keys)

Relying on a password is less secure than using SSH keys. Since your SSH server is now running, you should configure key-based authentication.

**On the Client Machine (Your Laptop):**

1.  **Generate a new SSH key pair** (if you don't already have one):

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519
    ```

2.  **Copy the public key** to your remote server:

    ```bash
    ssh-copy-id remote-acc-janak
    ```

    *This command will prompt for your Local host/server password one last time and then insert your public key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) into the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the remote server / local host.*

After this, when you run `ssh remote-acc-janak`, you will no longer be asked for a password, as your secure SSH key will handle the final authentication step automatically.

----

## HOST: Disabling Password-Based SSH Login

You need to edit the configuration file for the SSH server (`sshd`) on your **host machine**.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

- Modify the Authentication Directives

Scroll through the file (or use Ctrl+W to search) and ensure the following two directives are set exactly as shown below. Make sure to **uncomment** the lines (remove the `#` symbol) if they are commented out.

| Directive | Value | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PasswordAuthentication` | `no` | This is the main directive that blocks all password logins. |
| `PubkeyAuthentication` | `yes` | This ensures SSH key-based login remains active (it's usually `yes` by default). |

- Restart the SSH Service

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```
- Confirm Security Settings **On your Local PC (the Host/Server):**
  Verify password authentication is disabled
  ```bash
  grep -E 'PasswordAuthentication|PubkeyAuthentication' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  ```

  * **Expected Output:**
    ```
    PubkeyAuthentication yes
    PasswordAuthentication no
    ```

-----


## HOST: Prepare your host Deskop for remote desktop (RDP)

This configuration is for Debian 13 on KDE/Plasma environments.

<!-- 1.  **Modify the xRDP Startup Script:** This tells xRDP exactly which desktop environment to launch.
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh
    ```
2.  **Edit the Script:** Scroll to the bottom and **comment out** the two default startup lines, then **add** the `startplasma-x11` command:
    ```bash
    # test -x /etc/X11/Xsession && exec /etc/X11/Xsession
    # exec /bin/sh /etc/X11/Xsession

    # Add these lines for KDE
    startplasma-x11
    ```
3.  **Create `.xinitrc` File:** This ensures the session environment is initialized correctly for your user.
    ```bash
    nano ~/.xinitrc
    ```
    *Paste:*
    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh
    exec startplasma-x11
    ``` -->

1.  **Create/Edit `~/.xsession`:**

    ```bash
    nano ~/.xsession
    ```

2.  **Add the KDE/Plasma startup command:**

    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh
    # Explicitly start the KDE Plasma session
    exec /usr/bin/startplasma-x11
    ```

3.  **Make it Executable:** This is essential for the script to run.

    ```bash
    chmod +x ~/.xsession
    ```

4.  **Restart xRDP Service:** Apply the session changes.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart xrdp
    ```
5.  Reconnect

    1.  Ensure the `cloudflared access tcp` proxy is running on your client.
    2.  Connect your RDP client to `rdp://janak@127.0.0.1:33389`.
    3.  Enter your username and password.

    <!-- This combination of the explicit `startplasma-x11` command in both `startwm.sh` and the newly created `~/.xinitrc` is the most reliable way to force `xrdp` to launch a functional KDE session. -->

    The RDP client will connect to xrdp, which will run startwm.sh. The startwm.sh script will then execute /etc/X11/Xsession, which, in turn, reads your new executable ~/.xsession file and correctly launches the KDE Plasma desktop. This is the cleaner, multi-user way to configure sessions on many Linux distributions.

### Run the Cloudflared Client in TCP Mode (Client Machine)

You need to run a separate `cloudflared` command on the **client machine** that listens on a local port (e.g., `33389`), performs the Cloudflare Access handshake, and forwards all traffic to your tunnel hostname.

1.  **Open a New Terminal** on your **Client Machine**.

2.  **Run the RDP Proxy Command:** On the Client Machine (Keep this terminal open)

    ```bash
    /usr/local/bin/cloudflared access tcp --hostname desktop.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np --url 127.0.0.1:33389
    ```

      * **`access tcp`**: Tells `cloudflared` to act as a TCP proxy client.
      * **`--hostname`**: Specifies the remote hostname to connect to (your tunnel endpoint).
      * **`--url 127.0.0.1:33389`**: Tells `cloudflared` to listen on your local machine at port `33389` and forward any traffic it receives.


### Connect the RDP Client

Once the browser authentication is complete, your local proxy is running\!

1.  **Open your RDP Client** (e.g., Remmina and KRDC).
2.  **Connect to the local proxy address:**
      * **Host/IP:** `127.0.0.1` (or `localhost`)
      * **Port:** `33389` (The local port specified in the `cloudflared` command)

Your RDP client connects locally to `33389`, `cloudflared` forwards the traffic securely through the tunnel, and you should see the RDP login screen for your host machine.
- On the host machine, you have atleast 2 user one for current login session and other for remote desktop, because same luser cat login in 2 platform.
Local user is still logged in, creating a conflict.
Log out of your current session on the physical host machine. Do not just lock the screen—log out completely.

- Enter your login credential: username and password

## If you are Windows OS user:
-----

### 💻 Phase 1: Windows Client Setup

#### 1\. Install Cloudflared on Windows

You need the `cloudflared` client on your Windows machine to handle the secure tunneling and Cloudflare Access authentication.

1.  **Download:** Download the latest `cloudflared` executable file from [Cloudflare Download page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/downloads/)
2.  **Rename & Place:** Rename the downloaded file to just **`cloudflared.exe`** and place it in a simple location, like `C:\Cloudflared\`.
3.  **Add to Path (Optional but Recommended):** Add `C:\Cloudflared` to your Windows System Environment Variables PATH so you can run the command from any terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt).

-----

### 🔒 Phase 2: SSH Access (Using PowerShell/CMD)

For SSH, you'll use the built-in **OpenSSH Client** in Windows (or PuTTY/Git Bash).

#### 2\. Run the SSH Command

Since Windows SSH clients don't use the simple `~/.ssh/config` file in the same way, you must include the **ProxyCommand** directly in your terminal, or use a tool like Git Bash which supports the Linux-style configuration.

**In PowerShell or Command Prompt:** Run this command to SSH:

```powershell
ssh janak@ssh.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np -o ProxyCommand="C:\Cloudflared\cloudflared.exe access ssh --hostname %h"
```

#### Connection Flow:

1.  The command runs, executing the `ProxyCommand`.
2.  A browser window opens, prompting you to log in for **Cloudflare Access authentication**.
3.  Once authenticated, the terminal prompts you to accept the host key, and then logs you in using your **SSH Key** (if previously set up).

-----

### 🖥️ Phase 3: RDP Access (Using Remote Desktop Client)

For RDP, you must use the same **local proxy method** used on your Linux client, as the RDP client cannot run the authentication command itself.

#### 3\. Start the Cloudflared RDP Proxy

You need to run the `cloudflared` command in a separate, dedicated terminal window on your **Windows machine**.

1.  **Open PowerShell/Command Prompt** (as a normal user).

2.  **Run the RDP Proxy Command:** Keep this terminal window open for the entire session.

    ```powershell
    C:\Cloudflared\cloudflared.exe access tcp --hostname desktop.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np --url 127.0.0.1:33389
    ```

    *This command will prompt for **Cloudflare Access authentication** in a browser.*

#### 4\. Connect with Microsoft Remote Desktop

1.  Open the **Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection (MSTSC)** client (or another RDP client like Remmina).
2.  **Connect to the local proxy address:**
      * **Computer/Host:** `127.0.0.1:33389`
3.  Once the connection establishes, the RDP client will show the login prompt for your remote Linux host machine.

---


## **If you want to  Make the Tunnel Permanent/auto start on boot (Host Machine)**


### Manual Systemd Service Creation

We will create a service file that explicitly tells the operating system to run `cloudflared` using your user's configuration file.

### 1\. Stop the Foreground Tunnel (If Running)

Make sure you've pressed **Ctrl + C** in the terminal where the tunnel was running.

### 2\. Create the Service File

You need to create a new file for the service definition.

**On the Host Machine:**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/cloudflared-remote.service
```

### 3\. Paste the Service Configuration

Paste the following configuration into the file. **This file is configured specifically for your setup:**

  * It uses your username (`janak`).
  * It points directly to your configuration file (`/home/janak/.cloudflared/config.yml`).
  * It uses the correct tunnel name (`remote-acc`).

<!-- end list -->

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Cloudflare Tunnel Remote SSH Service
After=network.target

[Service]
# Set the user and group to run the tunnel as
User=janak #Your hostmachine's username
# The main executable. We use 'tunnel run' with the name of your tunnel.
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/cloudflared tunnel run remote-acc
# Ensure the service restarts if it fails
Restart=always
# Point the service to your existing config file
Environment="CLOUDFLARED_OPTS=--config /home/janak/.cloudflared/config.yml"
# Give up waiting if start takes too long
TimeoutStopSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

*Note: Make sure to verify the username `janak` is correct.*

Save the file and exit the editor.

### 4\. Manage the cloudflared-remote Service

Now, tell `systemd` about the new service file, enable it for boot, and start it.

**On the Host Machine:**

```bash
# Reload the systemd manager configuration
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Enable the service to start automatically on boot
sudo systemctl enable cloudflared-remote.service

# Start the tunnel service
sudo systemctl start cloudflared-remote.service

# Stop the tunnel service
sudo systemctl stop cloudflared-remote.service

# Disable this service on startup
sudo systemctl disable cloudflared-remote.service

# Check the status
sudo systemctl status cloudflared-remote.service
```

You should see **"Active: active (running)"**. You can now `close your host terminal`, and the tunnel will remain active.


### Apply Zero Trust Access Policies

You must secure both new hostnames in your Cloudflare Zero Trust Dashboard $\to$ **Access** $\to$ **Applications**, creating a separate **Self-hosted Application** for:

  * `ssh.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np`
  * `desktop.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np`
  * `localnode.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np`

For both, set the **Access Policy** to **Allow** only your verified **Email Address**.
