sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

---

### **2. Create a Project Directory**

```bash
mkdir Docker-wordpress && cd Docker-wordpress
```

---

### **3. Create `docker-compose.yml`**

Make a file called `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: janak
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: janak0ff
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: janak
    volumes:
      - ./wordpress_data:/var/www/html

  db:
    image: mariadb:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: janak0ff
      MYSQL_DATABASE: janak
      MYSQL_USER: janak
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: janak0ff
    volumes:
      - ./db_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  wordpress_data:
  db_data:
```

---

### **4. Start Containers**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Hosting a it with Apache Web Server

Apache HTTP Server is one of the most widely used open-source web servers. It allows you to host websites and applications, handle multiple domains on a single server, and even act as a reverse proxy to route traffic to backend applications running on different ports.

---

When you install Apache on a server, it listens on specific ports (by default, port `80` for HTTP and `443` for HTTPS). Apache uses **Virtual Hosts** to serve different websites or applications depending on the domain name or port.

There are two main types of web hosting with Apache:

1. **Direct Hosting (Static/Dynamic Files)**

   * Apache directly serves HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript files from a directory.
   * Example: A WordPress site hosted in `/var/www/html/`.

2. **Reverse Proxy Hosting**

   * Apache doesn’t serve the app directly. Instead, it forwards incoming requests to a backend service running on another port (e.g., Node.js on `3000`, Python Flask on `5000`, or WordPress on `8080`).
   * This is useful when your application runs on its own port but you want users to access it via a domain name.

---


1. **Install Apache**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install apache2 -y
   ```

2. **Enable Required Apache Modules**
   For reverse proxy hosting:

   ```bash
   sudo a2enmod proxy
   sudo a2enmod proxy_http
   sudo a2enmod headers
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

3. **Create a VirtualHost Configuration**
   Example: `/etc/apache2/sites-available/wp.conf`

   ```apache
   <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerName wp.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np

       ProxyPreserveHost On
       ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
       ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8080/

       ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/wp-error.log
       CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/wp-access.log combined
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

* **`<VirtualHost *:80>`**
  Tells Apache to listen on port `80` (HTTP) for all incoming connections.

* **`ServerName wp.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np`**
  Defines the domain name this configuration will respond to.

* **`ProxyPreserveHost On`**
  Keeps the original `Host` header from the client request, ensuring backend apps see the real domain name.

* **`ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/`**
  Forwards all requests from the root (`/`) to the backend running on `127.0.0.1:8080`.

* **`ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8080/`**
  Ensures that responses from the backend are correctly rewritten so that redirects and links point to the public domain instead of `127.0.0.1:8080`.

* **`ErrorLog` and `CustomLog`**
  Store error messages and access logs separately for this site, making debugging easier.


4. **Enable the Site and Reload Apache**

   ```bash
   sudo a2ensite wp.conf
   sudo systemctl reload apache2
   ```

5. **Point Your Domain to the Server**
   In your DNS settings, create an **A record** for `wp.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np` pointing to your server’s public IP.

6. **Access Your Application**
   Now your app running internally on `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` will be accessible via:

   ```
   http://wp.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np/
   ```

# Enabling HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt SSL in Apache

Let’s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority (CA) that provides SSL/TLS certificates to enable HTTPS. Combined with **Certbot**, we can easily install and configure SSL for our Apache-hosted site.

---

##  Steps to Enable SSL on Apache

### 1. Install Certbot and Apache Plugin

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache -y
```

### 2. Run Certbot for Your Domain

Use Certbot to automatically fetch and configure an SSL certificate:

```bash
sudo certbot --apache -d wp.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np
```

* `--apache` → tells Certbot to integrate directly with Apache.
* `-d` → specifies your domain name (make sure DNS is pointing to your server).

During the process, Certbot will:

* Verify your domain with Let’s Encrypt.
* Install the SSL certificate.
* Update your Apache VirtualHost configuration to listen on port `443`.
* Ask if you want to **redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS** (choose **Yes**).

### 3. Test the SSL Setup

Once finished, open:

```
https://wp.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np/
```

### 4. Auto-Renewal (Important!)

Let’s Encrypt certificates are valid for **90 days**. Certbot automatically creates a cron job for renewal. You can test it with:

```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

---

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

After running Certbot, Apache will have a new VirtualHost block for HTTPS in `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/wp-le-ssl.conf`, similar to:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName wp.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np

    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8080/

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/wp-error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/wp-access.log combined

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/wp.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np/fullchain.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/wp.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np/privkey.pem
    Include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf
</VirtualHost>
```

* `SSLEngine on` → enables SSL for this VirtualHost.
* `SSLCertificateFile` → points to the public SSL certificate.
* `SSLCertificateKeyFile` → points to the private key (kept secure on your server).
* `Include ...` → applies recommended SSL security settings.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

By setting up Let’s Encrypt SSL with Apache, we:

* Encrypted all traffic (HTTPS).
* Improved SEO ranking (Google favors HTTPS sites).
* Gained user trust with the secure padlock icon.
* Automated certificate renewal for long-term hassle-free security.

Now your web application is hosted **professionally with HTTPS** at:
👉 `https://wp.janakkumarshrestha0.com.np/`
