**The Assignment Tasks:**

1.  **Database Server Installation:**
    * Install the MySQL-compatible database server (MariaDB Server) on your Linux machine.
    * Secure your MariaDB installation using the provided script.

2.  **Database Creation:**
    * Create a new database named `broadway`.

3.  **User Management & Privileges:**
    * Create a new database user named `devops` with the password `123devops`.
    * Grant this `devops` user all necessary privileges to access databases from any host (`%`) or a specific remote IP address (if applicable).

4.  **Table Creation & Data Insertion:**
    * Within the `broadway` database, create a sample table (e.g., `movies`, `artists`, `shows`).
    * Insert several sample data records into your newly created table.

5.  **External Client Connectivity:**
    * Identify the default running port for your MariaDB server (e.g., 3306).
    * Configure your server's firewall (e.g., UFW) to allow incoming connections on this database port.
    * From a separate "physical host" machine (or your local machine if the server is a VM), use `telnet` to verify that the database port is reachable.
    * Install a graphical database client (e.g., DBeaver, a popular open-source tool, as "db-reaver" is not a standard client) on your physical host.
    * Establish a connection to your `broadway` database using the `devops` user from this client.
    * Confirm you can view the newly created table and the inserted data through the client.

6.  **Database Backup and Restore:**
    * Perform a database dump (backup) of the `broadway` database, saving it to a file with a unique name.
    * Create a new, empty database (e.g., `broadway_restored`).
    * Restore the data from your backup file into this new database.
    * Verify that the `broadway_restored` database now contains your table and data.

### Part 1: Setting up the MySQL/MariaDB Server

**1. Install MariaDB Server (as `mysql-server` alternative)**

* **Update package lists:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
* **Install MariaDB Server:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install mariadb-server
    ```
    During installation, you might be prompted to set a root password for MariaDB. If not, it will be set in the next security step.

* **Check status:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status mariadb
    ```
    (It should be `active (running)`. Press `q` to exit.)

**2. Secure MariaDB Installation**

This script enhances security by setting passwords, removing anonymous users, etc.

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
* **For `Enter current password for root:`**: If you weren't prompted for a password during install, just press **Enter**.
* **`Set root password? [Y/n]`**: Type `Y` and set a strong password. **Remember this password!**
* Follow the prompts, generally answering `Y` for recommended options (remove anonymous users, disallow remote root login, remove test database, reload privilege tables).

**3. Create a database `broadway`**

* **Log in to MariaDB shell as root:**
    ```bash
    sudo mysql
    ```
    (This logs you in as the database `root` user because your Linux user has `sudo` privileges and is connecting locally.)

* **Create the database:**
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE broadway;
    ```
    (Don't forget the semicolon `;` at the end of SQL commands).

* **Verify creation:**
    ```sql
    SHOW DATABASES;
    ```
    You should see `broadway` in the list.

**4. Create a user `devops` with password `123devops` and Grant all privileges**

**Important Security Note:** Using simple passwords like `123devops` and granting `ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.*` (on all databases) is generally **highly discouraged in production environments**. This is purely for this assignment.

* **Create the user and grant privileges (inside the MariaDB shell):**
    ```sql
    CREATE USER 'devops'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '123devops';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'devops'@'%';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```
    * `'devops'`: The username.
    * `'%'`: This means the user `devops` can connect from *any* host (including your "physical host"). If you wanted to restrict it to a specific IP (e.g., your physical host's IP `192.168.1.100`), you'd use `'devops'@'192.168.1.100'`. Using `%` is often necessary for assignments if your "physical host" IP might change or isn't fixed.
    * `'123devops'`: The password.
    * `ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.*`: Grants all permissions on all databases (`*.*`) to this user.
    * `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`: Reloads the grant tables to apply the changes immediately.

* **Exit the MariaDB shell:**
    ```sql
    exit
    ```

**5. Create a table on the database `broadway`**

* **Log back in as `devops` user (this time using the password):**
    ```bash
    mysql -u devops -p
    ```
    Enter `123devops` when prompted for the password.

* **Switch to the `broadway` database:**
    ```sql
    USE broadway;
    ```

* **Create a sample table (e.g., `movies`):**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE movies (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        director VARCHAR(255),
        release_year INT
    );
    ```

* **Verify table creation:**
    ```sql
    SHOW TABLES;
    DESCRIBE movies;
    ```

* **Exit the MariaDB shell:**
    ```sql
    exit
    ```

### Part 2: Connecting from your "Physical Host"

**Assumption for this part:** Your "Linux machine" (where the MariaDB server is installed) is a VM, and your "physical host" is the machine you're running your terminal from, which is separate from the VM. If your database server is *directly* on your physical machine, then "physical host" just refers to that same machine.

**6. Find the database running port and ensure network reachability**

* **Find MariaDB's Port:**
    MariaDB/MySQL's default port is `3306`. You can confirm this by checking its configuration file.
    ```bash
    grep -E "port|bind-address" /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
    ```
    You should see `port = 3306`. You might also see `bind-address = 127.0.0.1`. If it's `127.0.0.1`, it means MySQL is only listening on the local machine. To allow external connections, you would need to change this to `0.0.0.0` (listen on all interfaces) or your VM's specific IP address. **However, since we granted `devops@'%'`, the server should already be listening on interfaces for remote connections unless it's explicitly set to localhost only. Let's assume it's default for now.**

* **Firewall on your Linux Machine (VM):**
    You *must* open port `3306` on your Linux machine's firewall (UFW) to allow incoming connections.
    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow 3306/tcp
    sudo ufw reload
    sudo ufw status verbose # To verify the new rule
    ```

* **VM Network Configuration (if your database is on a VM):**
    This is crucial for "physical host" connectivity.
    * **Option A: Bridged Networking (Recommended for easy access on same LAN)**
        If your VM's network adapter is set to **Bridged**, it gets its own IP address on your local network (e.g., `192.168.1.105`). You can connect to this IP directly from your physical host.
    <!-- * **Option B: NAT with Port Forwarding (If Bridged isn't an option)**
        If your VM uses **NAT**, you need to set up port forwarding in your virtualization software (VirtualBox, VMware).
        * **Host Port:** Pick an unused port on your physical host (e.g., `33060`).
        * **Guest IP:** Your VM's internal IP (e.g., `10.0.2.15`).
        * **Guest Port:** `3306`.
        Then, your physical host will connect to its *own* IP on the `Host Port` you defined. -->

* **Find your Linux Machine's IP Address (VM or Physical):**
    On the Linux machine where MariaDB is running:
    ```bash
    ip a
    ```
    Look for the `inet` address of your network interface (e.g., `eth0`, `enp0s3`, `ens33`). This is the `DB_SERVER_IP` you'll use for `telnet` and client connection.

* **Do `telnet` from your Physical Host:**
    * First, install `telnet` on your **physical host** if it's not already there.
        * On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install telnet`
        * On Windows: Enable "Telnet Client" in "Turn Windows features on or off".
    * Now, from your **physical host's terminal**, try to connect to your `DB_SERVER_IP` on port `3306`.
        ```bash
        telnet DB_SERVER_IP 3306
        ```
         

        * **Success:** If you see a blank screen or a garbage character (like `~`), it means the connection was established. Press `Ctrl + ]`, then type `quit` and press `Enter`.
        ![output-sqlserver](@/assets/images/succ-telnet-sql.png)
        * **Failure:** If it says "Connection refused," "No route to host," or hangs, it means the port isn't reachable. Recheck your VM's firewall (`ufw`), MariaDB's `bind-address` in `50-server.cnf`, and your VM's network settings (Bridged/NAT + Port Forwarding).

       

**7. Install db-client (assuming DBeaver)**

Since `db-reaver` isn't a known client, I'm assuming you meant **DBeaver**, which is a very popular open-source GUI database client.

* **Install DBeaver on your Physical Host:**
    * **If your Physical Host is Linux (e.g., Ubuntu/Debian):**
        1.  Download the `.deb` package from the [DBeaver website](https://dbeaver.io/download/). Choose "Community Edition".
        2.  Install it using `dpkg`:
            ```bash
            sudo dpkg -i dbeaver-ce_*.deb
            sudo apt install -f # To fix any missing dependencies
            ```
        3.  Search for "DBeaver" in your applications menu to launch it.
    * **If your Physical Host is Windows/macOS:**
        Download the appropriate installer from the [DBeaver website](https://dbeaver.io/download/) and follow the installation wizard.

**8. Connect to the database using DBeaver (or your chosen client)**

* **Launch DBeaver.**
* Click on **Database -> New Database Connection**.
* Select **MySQL** (or MariaDB if it's an option). Click Next.
* **Settings:**
    * **Host:** Enter the `DB_SERVER_IP` you found earlier (your Linux machine's IP, or your host's IP if using NAT port forwarding).
    * **Port:** `3306` (or the `Host Port` if you used NAT port forwarding).
    * **Database:** `broadway`
    * **Username:** `devops`
    * **Password:** `123devops`
* Click **Test Connection...** to verify. If it works, click **Finish**.
* You should now see the `broadway` database and its tables in the DBeaver Navigator.

**9. See if you can see the table**

* In DBeaver (or your client), navigate through the connection to `broadway` database.
* Expand the "Tables" node. You should see your `movies` table listed.
* Right-click on `movies` table -> "View Data" or "Script Table -> SELECT statement" to see its structure.

**10. Insert some data into the table**

* In DBeaver, you can often right-click the `movies` table and choose "New Row" to insert data via a GUI.
* Alternatively, open an SQL editor in DBeaver (SQL Editor -> New SQL Script) and execute:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO movies (title, director, release_year) VALUES
    ('Inception', 'Christopher Nolan', 2010),
    ('The Matrix', 'Lana Wachowski', 1999),
    ('Pulp Fiction', 'Quentin Tarantino', 1994);
    ```
* Run a `SELECT` query to confirm data:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM movies;
    ```

### Part 3: Database Dump and Restore

**11. Dump the database with a unique file name**

This command should be run from your **Linux machine (VM)** terminal.

```bash
mysqldump -u devops -p broadway > broadway_dump_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
```
* `mysqldump`: The utility to dump MySQL/MariaDB databases.
* `-u devops`: Connects as the `devops` user.
* `-p`: Prompts for the password (123devops).
* `broadway`: The name of the database to dump.
* `>`: Redirects the output to a file.
* `broadway_dump_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql`: Creates a unique filename using the current date and time (e.g., `broadway_dump_20250525_143000.sql`).

**12. Create a new database and restore the dump to the new database**

* **Create a new database (inside MariaDB shell):**
    ```bash
    mysql -u devops -p
    ```
    (Enter `123devops` password)
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE broadway_restored;
    SHOW DATABASES;
    exit
    ```

* **Restore the dump to the new database (from your Linux machine's terminal):**
    ```bash
    mysql -u devops -p broadway_restored < broadway_dump_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
    ```
    * Replace `broadway_dump_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql` with the actual filename of your dump (you can use `ls` to find it).
    * `-u devops`: Connects as `devops`.
    * `-p`: Prompts for the password.
    * `broadway_restored`: The name of the new database to restore into.
    * `<`: Redirects the input from the SQL dump file.

* **Verify the restore (inside MariaDB shell):**
    ```bash
    mysql -u devops -p
    ```
    (Enter `123devops` password)
    ```sql
    USE broadway_restored;
    SHOW TABLES;
    SELECT * FROM movies;
    exit
    ```
    You should see the `movies` table and the data you inserted!
