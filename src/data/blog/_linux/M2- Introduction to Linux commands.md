# **Overview of Common Linux Shell Commands**

---

## **1. What is a Shell?**

### **Definition**

A **shell** is a powerful **command-line interpreter** used in Unix-like operating systems (like Linux and macOS).

- It acts as both:
  - An **interactive command language** for users to interact with the OS.
  - A **scripting language** for automating tasks.

### **Common Shells in Linux**

| Shell                  | Description                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bash** (`/bin/bash`) | Bourne Again SHell ‚Äì Default on most Linux distros |
| **sh**                 | Original Bourne shell                              |
| **ksh**                | KornShell ‚Äì Enhanced version of sh                 |
| **tcsh**               | Extended C Shell with advanced features            |
| **zsh**                | Z Shell ‚Äì Modern, feature-rich                     |
| **fish**               | Friendly Interactive SHell ‚Äì beginner-friendly     |

> In this course, we will use **Bash**, the default shell on most Linux systems.

### **How to Check Your Current Shell**

```bash
printenv SHELL
```

Example output:

```
/bin/bash
```

If not Bash, you can switch by typing:

```bash
bash
```

The `ps` command lists running processes. Use an option to show **all** processes.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
ps -e
```

This shows every process currently running on the system, not just those owned by the current user.

---

## üîπ **3. Get the table of processes and sort by memory usage**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `top` command and a keyboard shortcut to sort by memory.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
top
```

Once inside `top`, press:

```
Shift + M
```

This sorts the list by **memory usage**, allowing you to quickly identify which processes are using the most RAM.

> To exit `top`, press `q`.

---

## üîπ **4. Display the current time**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `date` command with a format specifier to show only the time.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
date "+%T"
```

Output example:

```
14:25:36
```

Other useful formats:

- `date "+%H:%M"` ‚Üí `14:25`
- `date "+%r"` ‚Üí `02:25:36 PM`

---

## üîπ **5. Using one command, display the messages "Hello!" and "Goodbye!" separated by a new line**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `echo` command with the `-e` option to interpret escape sequences like `\n`.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
echo -e "Hello!\nGoodbye!"
```

Output:

```
Hello!
Goodbye!
```

> The `-e` flag enables interpretation of backslash escapes like `\n` (new line) and `\t` (tab).

---

## üéØ Bonus Tips

- Combine `echo` with redirection to write text into files:
  ```bash
  echo "Hello World" > hello.txt
  ```
- Use `watch` to monitor changing output:
  ```bash
  watch "ps -e | head -n 10"
  ```

| Move or rename files            | `mv <src> <dest>` | Also used for renaming      |
| Change file permissions         | `chmod +x <file>` | Makes a file executable     |

---

## **6. Final Tips**

- Always double-check before using `rm -r` ‚Äî it's irreversible.
- Use `rmdir` when removing empty directories to avoid accidental deletion.
- `chmod` is essential for running scripts or setting up secure environments.
- Combine these commands with others like `ls`, `cd`, and `find` for powerful file operations.

### üìÅ Exercise 1 - Navigating Files and Directories

In this exercise, you practiced essential Linux commands for **navigating the filesystem**, **listing directory contents**, and understanding **file patterns**.

---

## üìç 1.1 Get the Location of the Present Working Directory

### Command:

```bash
pwd
```

### What It Does:

- Stands for **"Print Working Directory"**
- Shows the **full path** to the directory where you are currently located

Example output:

```
/home/theia
```

---

## üìã 1.2 List Files and Directories in a Directory

### Basic Usage:

```bash
ls
```

- Lists all **non-hidden files and directories** in the current location
- If the directory is empty, it returns nothing

### View Contents of `/bin` (Binary Directory):

```bash
ls /bin
```

- Displays system-level commands like `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, etc.
- You can also look at specific files:
  ```bash
  ls /bin/ls
  ```

### Use Wildcards to Match Patterns:

#### üîç All files starting with `b`:

```bash
ls /bin/b*
```

#### üîç All files ending with `r`:

```bash
ls /bin/*r
```

> üí° The `*` wildcard matches any number of characters

---

## üìÑ Long Listing Format

### See detailed file information:

```bash
ls -l
```

Includes:

- File type and permissions
- Number of links
- Owner
- Group
- Size in bytes
- Last modification date/time
- File or directory name

### Common `ls` Options:

| Option | Description                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `-a`   | Show hidden files (those starting with `.`) |
| `-d`   | Show directories only                       |
| `-h`   | Human-readable sizes (e.g., KB, MB)         |
| `-l`   | Long listing format                         |
| `-S`   | Sort by file size (largest first)           |
| `-t`   | Sort by modification time (newest first)    |
| `-r`   | Reverse sort order                          |

### Example: List all files (including hidden ones) in long format:

```bash
ls -la
```

### Example: List all files in `/etc` with details:

```bash
ls -la /etc
```

This helps you explore system-wide configuration files.

### üìÅ Exercise 2 - Creating Files and Directories

In this exercise, you practiced using Linux commands to **create directories**, **navigate the filesystem**, and **create or update files** using the `touch` command.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary of Commands Covered

| Task                                     | Command                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Create a directory                       | `mkdir directory_name` |
| Change working directory                 | `cd directory_name`    |
| Move up one directory level              | `cd ..`                |
| Go back to home directory                | `cd`                   |
| Create an empty file or update timestamp | `touch filename`       |

---

## üßæ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 2.1 Create a Directory with `mkdir`

```bash
mkdir scripts
```

- Creates a new directory named `scripts` in your current location

Verify it was created:

```bash
ls
```

You should see `scripts` listed.

---

### üîπ 2.2 Change Working Directory with `cd`

Move into the `scripts` directory:

```bash
cd scripts
```

Check your current location:

```bash
pwd
```

Return to your home directory:

```bash
cd
```

Move up one level (to the parent directory):

```bash
cd ..
```

This is useful when navigating through nested directories.

---

### üîπ 2.3 Create an Empty File with `touch`

Go back to your home directory:

```bash
cd
```

Create a new file called `myfile.txt`:

```bash
touch myfile.txt
```

Verify the file exists:

```bash
ls
```

If the file already exists, `touch` updates its **last-modified timestamp**:

```bash
touch myfile.txt
```

To check the updated timestamp:

```bash
date -r myfile.txt
```

This shows the last time the file was accessed or modified.

---

## üìã Tips & Tricks

- You can create multiple directories at once:
  ```bash
  mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
  ```
- Make a nested directory structure easily:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p project/files/data
  ```
  The `-p` option creates parent directories as needed.
- Use tab completion for faster navigation:
  ```bash
  cd scri<TAB>
  ```
  Completes to:
  ```bash
  cd scripts
  ```

---

## üß† Why These Commands Matter

These basic tools are essential for managing your workspace in Linux:

- `mkdir`: Organize your files by creating structured directories
- `cd`: Navigate between folders quickly
- `touch`: Create placeholder files or update timestamps for testing or scripting purposes

---

### üìÅ Exercise 3 - Managing Files and Directories

In this exercise, you practiced essential Linux commands for **searching**, **removing**, **moving**, **renaming**, and **copying** files and directories ‚Äî key skills for managing your system effectively.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary of Commands Covered

| Task                  | Command       |
| --------------------- | ------------- |
| Search for files      | `find`        |
| Remove (delete) files | `rm`, `rm -i` |
| Move or rename files  | `mv`          |
| Copy files            | `cp`          |

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 3.1 Search for Files Using `find`

```bash
find /etc -name '*.txt'
```

- Searches the `/etc` directory and its subdirectories for all `.txt` files.
- `-name` specifies a filename pattern to match.
- You may see "Permission denied" errors ‚Äî these are normal due to access restrictions in lab environments.

---

### üîπ 3.2 Remove Files with `rm`

```bash
rm -i myfile.txt
```

- The `-i` option prompts for confirmation before deletion:
  ```
  rm: remove regular file 'myfile.txt'? y/n
  ```

After deletion, verify:

```bash
ls
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Deleted files **cannot be recovered easily**. Always double-check what you're deleting.

Use without `-i` only when sure:

```bash
rm myfile.txt
```

Delete multiple files safely using confirmation:

```bash
rm -i *.txt
```

---

### üîπ 3.3 Move or Rename Files with `mv`

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Rename a File:

```bash
mv users.txt user-info.txt
```

This renames `users.txt` to `user-info.txt` in the same directory.

Verify:

```bash
ls
```

#### üì¶ Move a File to Another Directory:

```bash
mv user-info.txt /tmp
```

Moves `user-info.txt` to the `/tmp` directory.

Verify:

```bash
ls
ls -l /tmp
```

> üí° If the target file already exists, it will be overwritten silently ‚Äî always be cautious!

---

### üîπ 3.4 Copy Files with `cp`

#### üìÑ Copy from One Location to Another:

```bash
cp /tmp/user-info.txt user-info.txt
```

This copies the file back to your current working directory.

Verify:

```bash
ls
```

#### üìÇ Copy Content of a System File:

```bash
cp /etc/passwd users.txt
```

This creates a new file `users.txt` containing the contents of `/etc/passwd`.

Check that the copy was successful:

```bash
ls
cat users.txt
```

You can also view the first few lines:

```bash
head users.txt
```

---

## üß∞ Pro Tips

- Use wildcards to move or copy groups of files:
  ```bash
  cp *.txt /backup/
  mv *.log logs/
  ```
- Combine `cp` with `-r` to copy entire directories:
  ```bash
  cp -r myfolder/ backup/
  ```
- Use `rm -r` carefully to delete directories and their contents:
  ```bash
  rm -r myfolder
  ```

---

## üß† Why These Commands Matter

These tools give you full control over your filesystem:

- `find`: Locate files across your system
- `rm`: Clean up unwanted files
- `mv`: Reorganize or rename files
- `cp`: Duplicate or archive content

They form the foundation for automating tasks, writing scripts, and managing data efficiently.

---

### üìö **Practice Exercises ‚Äì Managing Files and Directories**

Here are the practice exercises with **hints** and **solutions** to help reinforce your understanding of Linux commands for navigating, creating, moving, copying, and deleting files and directories.

---

## üîπ **1. Display the contents of the /home directory**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `ls` command to list directory contents.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
ls /home
```

This shows all user directories inside `/home`.

---

## üîπ **2. Ensure that you are in your home directory**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `cd` command without arguments to return to your home directory.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cd
```

You can verify using:

```bash
pwd
```

It should output something like:

```
/home/theia
```

---

## üîπ **3. Create a new directory called tmp and verify its creation**

### üí° Hint:

Use `mkdir` to create a directory and `ls` to confirm it exists.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
mkdir tmp
ls
```

You should see `tmp` listed in the output.

---

## üîπ **4. Create a new, empty file named display.sh in the tmp directory, and verify its creation**

### üí° Hint:

Navigate into the `tmp` directory and use `touch` to create an empty file.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cd tmp
touch display.sh
ls
```

You should see `display.sh` listed.

---

## üîπ **5. Create a copy of display.sh, called report.sh, within the same directory**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `cp` command to make a copy of a file.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cp display.sh report.sh
ls
```

Now both `display.sh` and `report.sh` should be listed.

---

## üîπ **6. Move your copied file, report.sh, up one level in the directory tree to the parent directory. Verify your changes**

### üí° Hint:

Use `mv` to move the file and `cd ..` or `ls -l ../` to check.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
mv report.sh ..
ls ..
```

Or:

```bash
cd ..
ls
```

You should now see `report.sh` in the parent directory.

---

## üîπ **7. Delete the file display.sh**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `rm` command to delete a file. Consider using `-i` for confirmation (optional).

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
rm display.sh
```

To verify:

```bash
ls
```

The file `display.sh` should no longer appear.

---

## üîπ **8. List the files in /etc directory in the ascending order of their access time**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `ls` command with appropriate options to sort by access time.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
ls -ltu /etc
```

- `-l` = long listing format
- `-t` = sort by modification time (but combined with `-u`, sorts by access time)
- `-u` = use access time for sorting

> This lists files sorted by when they were last accessed, newest first.

---

## üîπ **9. Copy the file /var/log/bootstrap.log to your current directory**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `cp` command to copy a file from its source path to the current directory.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cp /var/log/bootstrap.log .
```

To verify:

```bash
ls
```

You should see `bootstrap.log` in your current directory.

---

## üß† Bonus Tips

- Use tab completion to avoid typing full paths:
  ```bash
  cp /va<TAB>/lo<TAB>/boo<TAB> .
  ```
- Combine `ls` options for better readability:
  ```bash
  ls -lh
  ```
- Use `rm -i` when unsure:
  ```bash
  rm -i *.tmp
  ```

---

Great job completing these hands-on exercises! You're now comfortable with basic file and directory management in Linux.

---

### üîí **Security: Managing File Permissions and Ownership ‚Äì Summary & Guide**

In this reading, you learned how to manage **file permissions** and **ownership** in Linux ‚Äî a crucial skill for protecting sensitive data and ensuring system security.

---

## üéØ **Learning Objectives Recap**

By the end of this section, you should be able to:

- Explain file ownership and permissions
- View file and directory permissions
- Make files private by changing permission settings

---

## üîê Why File Permissions Matter

Linux is a **multi-user operating system**, which means multiple people can access the same machine. Without proper permissions:

- Anyone could **read or modify your files**
- Malicious users might **execute harmful scripts**
- Sensitive documents (like tax records or company IP) could be **exposed**

That‚Äôs why **permissions and ownership** allow fine-grained control over who can read, write, or execute files.

---

## üë§ Types of Owners in Linux

There are **three categories** of users that determine permission levels:

| Category      | Meaning                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **user (u)**  | The owner of the file (usually the creator) |
| **group (g)** | A group of users assigned to the file       |
| **other (o)** | Everyone else with access to the system     |

Each category has its own set of permissions:

- `r` = Read
- `w` = Write
- `x` = Execute

---

## üëÄ Viewing File Permissions

Use:

```bash
ls -l filename
```

Example output:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 theia users 25 Dec 22 17:47 my_new_file
```

- `-`: Indicates it's a regular file
- `rw-`: User (owner) permissions
- `r--`: Group permissions
- `r--`: Others' permissions

üìò For directories:

- `d` at the start indicates it's a directory
- Permissions mean:
  - `r`: Can list contents (`ls`)
  - `w`: Can create or delete files inside
  - `x`: Can enter the directory (`cd`)

---

## üîß Changing File Permissions with `chmod`

You can change permissions using:

```bash
chmod [options] filename
```

### Example: Make a file private

```bash
chmod go-r my_new_file
```

This removes **read** permission for **group** and **others**.

After running:

```bash
ls -l my_new_file
```

You'll see:

```
-rw------- 1 theia users 24 Dec 22 18:49 my_new_file
```

Now only the **owner** can read and write to the file.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only the **owner** or **root** can change permissions on a file.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Common `chmod` Syntax Options

| Command               | Action                                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `chmod u+x file.sh`   | Add execute permission for the user          |
| `chmod go-w file.txt` | Remove write permission for group and others |
| `chmod 755 file.sh`   | Set numeric permissions (see below)          |

### Numeric Permission Notation

Each permission level has a number value:

- `r` = 4
- `w` = 2
- `x` = 1

Sum them to get numeric values:

| Permission | Value |
| ---------- | ----- |
| `rwx`      | 7     |
| `rw-`      | 6     |
| `r-x`      | 5     |
| `r--`      | 4     |

Example:

```bash
chmod 600 secret.txt
```

Only the owner has **read and write** access.

---

## üìÅ Executable Files and Shell Scripts

To make a shell script executable:

1. Add a **shebang** line at the top:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   ```
2. Give it execute permission:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
   ```
3. Run it:
   ```bash
   ./script.sh
   ```

This tells the OS that the file is a program written in Bash (or another interpreter).

---

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Concept                | Description                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **User (u)**           | Owner of the file                              |
| **Group (g)**          | Group of users who share ownership             |
| **Other (o)**          | All other users                                |
| **Permissions**        | `r` = read, `w` = write, `x` = execute         |
| **View Permissions**   | `ls -l`                                        |
| **Change Permissions** | `chmod`                                        |
| **Make Private**       | `chmod go-rwx filename`                        |
| **Numeric Mode**       | `chmod 600 filename`                           |
| **Directories**        | `r` = list, `w` = modify contents, `x` = enter |

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Use `chmod 700 folder` to keep a directory private
- Protect sensitive scripts with `chmod 600 script.sh`
- Use `id` to see what groups you belong to
- Use `chown` (as root) to change file ownership

---

You're now equipped with the knowledge to **secure your files**, **control access**, and **protect sensitive data** in a Linux environment.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Exercise 1 - Viewing and Modifying File Access Permissions

In this exercise, you learned how to **view** and **modify file permissions** in Linux using the `ls -l` and `chmod` commands. Understanding and managing permissions is essential for maintaining system security and controlling access to your files.

---

## üìÅ 1.1 View File Access Permissions

### üîß Steps:

1. Navigate to your project directory:

   ```bash
   cd /home/project
   ```

2. Download the required file:

   ```bash
   wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-LX0117EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/module%201/usdoi.txt
   ```

3. View the file's permissions:
   ```bash
   ls -l usdoi.txt
   ```

### ‚úÖ Sample Output:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 theia theia 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

### üìù Breakdown of Permission String: `-rw-r--r--`

| Part  | Meaning                                       |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `-`   | It's a regular file (use `d` for directories) |
| `rw-` | User (owner) has **read** and **write**       |
| `r--` | Group has only **read**                       |
| `r--` | Others have only **read**                     |

---

## üîê 1.2 Change File Access Permissions with `chmod`

The `chmod` command allows you to modify who can **read**, **write**, or **execute** a file.

### üîß Syntax:

```bash
chmod [who][operator][permission] filename
```

| Component    | Values                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `who`        | `u` = user, `g` = group, `o` = others, `a` = all |
| `operator`   | `+` = add, `-` = remove, `=` = set exactly       |
| `permission` | `r` = read, `w` = write, `x` = execute           |

---

### üîç Example Commands

#### ‚ùå Remove read permission for all users:

```bash
chmod -r usdoi.txt
```

Verify:

```bash
ls -l usdoi.txt
```

You'll see something like:

```
--w------- 1 theia theia 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

#### ‚úÖ Restore read permission for all users:

```bash
chmod +r usdoi.txt
```

Verify:

```bash
ls -l usdoi.txt
```

You should return to:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 theia theia 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

#### üö´ Remove read permission only for "other":

```bash
chmod o-r usdoi.txt
```

Verify:

```bash
ls -l usdoi.txt
```

Now output will be:

```
-rw-r----- 1 theia theia 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

Only **user** and **group** can read the file now.

| Add read to all                         | `chmod +r filename`  |
| Remove read from others                 | `chmod o-r filename` |
| Add execute to user                     | `chmod u+x filename` |
| Set exact permissions (e.g., rw-------) | `chmod 600 filename` |

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Use **numeric mode** for precision:
  ```bash
  chmod 644 usdoi.txt    # rw-r--r--
  chmod 700 secret.sh     # rwx------
  ```
- Always double-check permissions on sensitive files:
  ```bash
  ls -l secret.txt
  ```
- Only the **file owner** or **root** can change permissions.

---

Great job completing this exercise! You're now able to view and manage file permissions ‚Äî an essential skill for working securely in Linux.

---

### üìÅ Exercise 2 - Understanding Directory Access Permissions

In this exercise, you explored how **directory permissions** in Linux work and how they differ from file permissions. You learned that **execute (`x`) permission is required to enter a directory**, and **write (`w`) permission is needed to create or delete files inside it**.

---

## üîç Summary of What You Learned

| Permission    | Meaning for Directories                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `r` (read)    | Allows listing contents with `ls`        |
| `w` (write)   | Allows adding/removing files             |
| `x` (execute) | Allows entering the directory using `cd` |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Even if you have write access, you can't modify contents without execute permission!

## üßæ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 2.1 View Default Directory Access Permissions

#### Create a new directory:

```bash
cd /home/project
mkdir test
```

#### Check its permissions:

```bash
ls -l
```

Output example:

```
drwxr-sr-x 2 theia users 4096 May 15 14:06 test
```

- `d`: Indicates it's a directory
- `rwx`: Owner (user) has read, write, and execute
- `r-s`: Group has read and setgid (special permission)
- `r-x`: Others have read and execute

You verified that:

- You could enter the directory
- You could create a subdirectory inside it

Commands used:

```bash
cd test
mkdir test2
cd ..
```

> üí° The `s` in group permissions is a special flag called **setgid** ‚Äî it ensures new files inherit the group of the parent directory.

---

### üîπ 2.2 Remove User Execute Permissions

#### Remove execute permission for owner:

```bash
chmod u-x test
```

Now try:

```bash
cd test
```

‚ùå Output:

```
bash: cd: test: Permission denied
```

Even though you still have read and write permissions, **you can't enter the directory** without execute permission.

Try listing contents:

```bash
ls -l test
```

‚úÖ Works ‚Äî because you still have **read** permission.

Try creating a subdirectory:

```bash
mkdir test/test3
```

‚ùå Fails ‚Äî because **write requires execute**.

---

### üîÅ Restore Permissions

#### Add back execute:

```bash
chmod u+x test
```

#### Remove write:

```bash
chmod u-w test
```

Check current permissions:

```bash
ls -l
```

Now try:

```bash
cd test
mkdir test_again
```

‚ùå Output:

```
mkdir: cannot create directory ‚Äòtest_again‚Äô: Permission denied
```

You can **enter** the directory (thanks to `x`), but you **can't modify** it (because you don‚Äôt have `w`).

## üß† Key Takeaways

| Scenario               | Required Permission                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| List contents (`ls`)   | `r`                                             |
| Enter directory (`cd`) | `x`                                             |
| Create/delete files    | `w` + `x`                                       |
| Rename or move files   | `w` + `x` in both source and target directories |

> üß© Think of `x` as a key to open a door ‚Äî you need it before you can do anything useful inside a directory.

| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ls -l`            | Show directory permissions                                |
| `chmod u+x dir`    | Allow user to enter directory                             |
| `chmod u-w dir`    | Prevent user from modifying directory contents            |
| `cd dir`           | Requires execute (`x`) permission                         |
| `ls dir`           | Requires read (`r`) permission                            |
| `mkdir dir/subdir` | Requires write (`w`) + execute (`x`) permissions on `dir` |

You've now mastered how **directory permissions** control access differently than file permissions ‚Äî an essential concept for securing and managing your Linux system effectively.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Practice Exercises ‚Äì File and Directory Permissions**

Here are the **practice exercises** with hints and full solutions to help you reinforce your understanding of Linux file and directory permissions.

---

## üîπ **1. List the permissions set for the file `usdoi.txt`**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `ls -l` command to view file permissions.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
ls -l usdoi.txt
```

Example output:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 theia users 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

This shows that:

- The owner has **read and write**
- The group has **read**
- Others have **read**

---

## üîπ **2. Revoke the write permission on `usdoi.txt` for the user, and verify**

### üí° Hint:

Use `chmod u-w` to remove write access for the user.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
chmod u-w usdoi.txt
ls -l usdoi.txt
```

New output:

```
-r--r--r-- 1 theia users 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

The user (owner) no longer has **write** permission.

---

## üîπ **3. What happens if you try to delete `usdoi.txt` after revoking write permissions?**

### üí° Hint:

You don‚Äôt need write permission to delete a file ‚Äî but you **do** need write permission in the **directory** it‚Äôs in.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

Try deleting:

```bash
rm usdoi.txt
```

‚úÖ It works!  
Even though you removed write permission **on the file**, you can still delete it because:

- You own the file
- You have **write permission in the directory**

> üîç Note: If you didn‚Äôt own the file, you could still delete it as long as:
>
> - You had **write** permission in the directory
> - You didn't own the file

---

## üîπ **4. Create a new directory called `tmp_dir` in your home directory**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `mkdir` command.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir tmp_dir
```

Now you have a new directory in your home folder.

---

## üîπ **5. View the permissions of the newly created directory `tmp_dir`**

### üí° Hint:

Use `ls -l` again to see directory permissions.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
ls -l
```

Output will include something like:

```
drwxr-xr-x 2 theia users 4096 Apr 5 10:00 tmp_dir
```

This means:

- User: read, write, execute
- Group: read, execute
- Others: read, execute

---

## üîπ **6. Revoke the user write permission for `tmp_dir`**

### üí° Hint:

Use `chmod u-w` on the directory.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
chmod u-w tmp_dir
ls -l
```

New output:

```
dr-xr-xr-x 2 theia users 4096 Apr 5 10:00 tmp_dir
```

User now only has **execute** and **read** ‚Äî not **write**.

---

## üîπ **7. Check whether you can create a subdirectory `sub_dir` inside `tmp_dir`**

### üí° Hint:

Use `mkdir` to attempt creating a subdirectory.

### ‚úÖ Solution 1:

```bash
mkdir tmp_dir/sub_dir
```

‚ùå Output:

```
mkdir: cannot create directory ‚Äòtmp_dir/sub_dir‚Äô: Permission denied
```

### ‚úÖ Solution 2 Explanation:

Even though you have **execute** (`x`) permission on `tmp_dir`, which allows you to **enter** the directory, you **don‚Äôt have write** (`w`) permission ‚Äî so you **can't modify** its contents (like creating or deleting files or directories).
