# **Overview of Common Linux Shell Commands**

---

## **1. What is a Shell?**

### **Definition**

A **shell** is a powerful **command-line interpreter** used in Unix-like operating systems (like Linux and macOS).

- It acts as both:
  - An **interactive command language** for users to interact with the OS.
  - A **scripting language** for automating tasks.

### **Common Shells in Linux**

| Shell                  | Description                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bash** (`/bin/bash`) | Bourne Again SHell ‚Äì Default on most Linux distros |
| **sh**                 | Original Bourne shell                              |
| **ksh**                | KornShell ‚Äì Enhanced version of sh                 |
| **tcsh**               | Extended C Shell with advanced features            |
| **zsh**                | Z Shell ‚Äì Modern, feature-rich                     |
| **fish**               | Friendly Interactive SHell ‚Äì beginner-friendly     |

> In this course, we will use **Bash**, the default shell on most Linux systems.

### **How to Check Your Current Shell**

```bash
printenv SHELL
```

Example output:

```
/bin/bash
```

If not Bash, you can switch by typing:

```bash
bash
```

```

Once inside `top`, press:

```
Shift + M
```

This sorts the list by **memory usage**, allowing you to quickly identify which processes are using the most RAM.

> To exit `top`, press `q`.

---

## üîπ **4. Display the current time**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `date` command with a format specifier to show only the time.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
date "+%T"
```

Output example:

```
14:25:36
```

Other useful formats:

- `date "+%H:%M"` ‚Üí `14:25`
- `date "+%r"` ‚Üí `02:25:36 PM`

---

## üîπ **5. Using one command, display the messages "Hello!" and "Goodbye!" separated by a new line**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `echo` command with the `-e` option to interpret escape sequences like `\n`.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
echo -e "Hello!\nGoodbye!"
```

Output:

```
Hello!
Goodbye!
```

> The `-e` flag enables interpretation of backslash escapes like `\n` (new line) and `\t` (tab).

---

## üéØ Bonus Tips

- Combine `echo` with redirection to write text into files:
  ```bash
  echo "Hello World" > hello.txt
  ```
- Use `watch` to monitor changing output:
  ```bash
  watch "ps -e | head -n 10"
  ```

| Copy files                      | `cp <src> <dest>` | Use `cp -r` for directories |
| Move or rename files            | `mv <src> <dest>` | Also used for renaming      |
| Change file permissions         | `chmod +x <file>` | Makes a file executable     |

---

## **6. Final Tips**

- Always double-check before using `rm -r` ‚Äî it's irreversible.
- Use `rmdir` when removing empty directories to avoid accidental deletion.
- `chmod` is essential for running scripts or setting up secure environments.
- Combine these commands with others like `ls`, `cd`, and `find` for powerful file operations.

### üìÅ Exercise 1 - Navigating Files and Directories

In this exercise, you practiced essential Linux commands for **navigating the filesystem**, **listing directory contents**, and understanding **file patterns**.

---

## üìç 1.1 Get the Location of the Present Working Directory

### Command:

```bash
pwd
```

### What It Does:

- Stands for **"Print Working Directory"**
- Shows the **full path** to the directory where you are currently located

Example output:

```
/home/theia
```

---

## üìã 1.2 List Files and Directories in a Directory

### Basic Usage:

```bash
ls
```

- Lists all **non-hidden files and directories** in the current location
- If the directory is empty, it returns nothing

### View Contents of `/bin` (Binary Directory):

```bash
ls /bin
```

- Displays system-level commands like `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, etc.
- You can also look at specific files:
  ```bash
  ls /bin/ls
  ```

### Use Wildcards to Match Patterns:

#### üîç All files starting with `b`:

```bash
ls /bin/b*
```

#### üîç All files ending with `r`:

```bash
ls /bin/*r
```

> üí° The `*` wildcard matches any number of characters

---

## üìÑ Long Listing Format

### See detailed file information:

```bash
ls -l
```

Includes:

- File type and permissions
- Number of links
- Owner
- Group
- Size in bytes
- Last modification date/time
- File or directory name

### Common `ls` Options:

| Option | Description                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `-a`   | Show hidden files (those starting with `.`) |
| `-d`   | Show directories only                       |
| `-h`   | Human-readable sizes (e.g., KB, MB)         |
| `-l`   | Long listing format                         |
| `-S`   | Sort by file size (largest first)           |
| `-t`   | Sort by modification time (newest first)    |
| `-r`   | Reverse sort order                          |

### Example: List all files (including hidden ones) in long format:

```bash
ls -la
```

### Example: List all files in `/etc` with details:

```bash
ls -la /etc
```

This helps you explore system-wide configuration files.

### üìÅ Exercise 2 - Creating Files and Directories

In this exercise, you practiced using Linux commands to **create directories**, **navigate the filesystem**, and **create or update files** using the `touch` command.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary of Commands Covered

| Task                                     | Command                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Create a directory                       | `mkdir directory_name` |
| Change working directory                 | `cd directory_name`    |
| Move up one directory level              | `cd ..`                |
| Go back to home directory                | `cd`                   |
| Create an empty file or update timestamp | `touch filename`       |

---

## üßæ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 2.1 Create a Directory with `mkdir`

```bash
mkdir scripts
```

- Creates a new directory named `scripts` in your current location

Verify it was created:

```bash
ls
```

You should see `scripts` listed.

---

### üîπ 2.2 Change Working Directory with `cd`

Move into the `scripts` directory:

```bash
cd scripts
```

Check your current location:

```bash
pwd
```

Return to your home directory:

```bash
cd
```

Move up one level (to the parent directory):

```bash
cd ..
```

This is useful when navigating through nested directories.

---

### üîπ 2.3 Create an Empty File with `touch`

Go back to your home directory:

```bash
cd
```

Create a new file called `myfile.txt`:

```bash
touch myfile.txt
```

Verify the file exists:

```bash
ls
```

If the file already exists, `touch` updates its **last-modified timestamp**:

```bash
touch myfile.txt
```

To check the updated timestamp:

```bash
date -r myfile.txt
```

This shows the last time the file was accessed or modified.

---

## üìã Tips & Tricks

- You can create multiple directories at once:
  ```bash
  mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
  ```
- Make a nested directory structure easily:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p project/files/data
  ```
  The `-p` option creates parent directories as needed.
- Use tab completion for faster navigation:
  ```bash
  cd scri<TAB>
  ```
  Completes to:
  ```bash
  cd scripts
  ```

---

## üß† Why These Commands Matter

These basic tools are essential for managing your workspace in Linux:

- `mkdir`: Organize your files by creating structured directories
- `cd`: Navigate between folders quickly
- `touch`: Create placeholder files or update timestamps for testing or scripting purposes

---

### üìÅ Exercise 3 - Managing Files and Directories

In this exercise, you practiced essential Linux commands for **searching**, **removing**, **moving**, **renaming**, and **copying** files and directories ‚Äî key skills for managing your system effectively.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary of Commands Covered

| Task                  | Command       |
| --------------------- | ------------- |
| Search for files      | `find`        |
| Remove (delete) files | `rm`, `rm -i` |
| Move or rename files  | `mv`          |
| Copy files            | `cp`          |

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 3.1 Search for Files Using `find`

```bash
find /etc -name '*.txt'
```

- Searches the `/etc` directory and its subdirectories for all `.txt` files.
- `-name` specifies a filename pattern to match.
- You may see "Permission denied" errors ‚Äî these are normal due to access restrictions in lab environments.

---

### üîπ 3.2 Remove Files with `rm`

```bash
rm -i myfile.txt
```

- The `-i` option prompts for confirmation before deletion:
  ```
  rm: remove regular file 'myfile.txt'? y/n
  ```

After deletion, verify:

```bash
ls
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Deleted files **cannot be recovered easily**. Always double-check what you're deleting.

Use without `-i` only when sure:

```bash
rm myfile.txt
```

Delete multiple files safely using confirmation:

```bash
rm -i *.txt
```

---

### üîπ 3.3 Move or Rename Files with `mv`

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Rename a File:

```bash
mv users.txt user-info.txt
```

This renames `users.txt` to `user-info.txt` in the same directory.

Verify:

```bash
ls
```

#### üì¶ Move a File to Another Directory:

```bash
mv user-info.txt /tmp
```

Moves `user-info.txt` to the `/tmp` directory.

Verify:

```bash
ls
ls -l /tmp
```

> üí° If the target file already exists, it will be overwritten silently ‚Äî always be cautious!

---

### üîπ 3.4 Copy Files with `cp`

#### üìÑ Copy from One Location to Another:

```bash
cp /tmp/user-info.txt user-info.txt
```

This copies the file back to your current working directory.

Verify:

```bash
ls
```

#### üìÇ Copy Content of a System File:

```bash
cp /etc/passwd users.txt
```

This creates a new file `users.txt` containing the contents of `/etc/passwd`.

Check that the copy was successful:

```bash
ls
cat users.txt
```

You can also view the first few lines:

```bash
head users.txt
```

---

## üß∞ Pro Tips

- Use wildcards to move or copy groups of files:
  ```bash
  cp *.txt /backup/
  mv *.log logs/
  ```
- Combine `cp` with `-r` to copy entire directories:
  ```bash
  cp -r myfolder/ backup/
  ```
- Use `rm -r` carefully to delete directories and their contents:
  ```bash
  rm -r myfolder
  ```

---

## üß† Why These Commands Matter

These tools give you full control over your filesystem:

- `find`: Locate files across your system
- `rm`: Clean up unwanted files
- `mv`: Reorganize or rename files
- `cp`: Duplicate or archive content

They form the foundation for automating tasks, writing scripts, and managing data efficiently.

---

### üìö **Practice Exercises ‚Äì Managing Files and Directories**

Here are the practice exercises with **hints** and **solutions** to help reinforce your understanding of Linux commands for navigating, creating, moving, copying, and deleting files and directories.

---

## üîπ **1. Display the contents of the /home directory**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `ls` command to list directory contents.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
ls /home
```

This shows all user directories inside `/home`.

---

## üîπ **2. Ensure that you are in your home directory**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `cd` command without arguments to return to your home directory.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cd
```

You can verify using:

```bash
pwd
```

It should output something like:

```
/home/theia
```

---

## üîπ **3. Create a new directory called tmp and verify its creation**

### üí° Hint:

Use `mkdir` to create a directory and `ls` to confirm it exists.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
mkdir tmp
ls
```

You should see `tmp` listed in the output.

---

## üîπ **4. Create a new, empty file named display.sh in the tmp directory, and verify its creation**

### üí° Hint:

Navigate into the `tmp` directory and use `touch` to create an empty file.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cd tmp
touch display.sh
ls
```

You should see `display.sh` listed.

---

## üîπ **5. Create a copy of display.sh, called report.sh, within the same directory**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `cp` command to make a copy of a file.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cp display.sh report.sh
ls
```

Now both `display.sh` and `report.sh` should be listed.

---

## üîπ **6. Move your copied file, report.sh, up one level in the directory tree to the parent directory. Verify your changes**

### üí° Hint:

Use `mv` to move the file and `cd ..` or `ls -l ../` to check.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
mv report.sh ..
ls ..
```

Or:

```bash
cd ..
ls
```

You should now see `report.sh` in the parent directory.

---

## üîπ **7. Delete the file display.sh**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `rm` command to delete a file. Consider using `-i` for confirmation (optional).

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
rm display.sh
```

To verify:

```bash
ls
```

The file `display.sh` should no longer appear.

---

## üîπ **8. List the files in /etc directory in the ascending order of their access time**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `ls` command with appropriate options to sort by access time.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
ls -ltu /etc
```

- `-l` = long listing format
- `-t` = sort by modification time (but combined with `-u`, sorts by access time)
- `-u` = use access time for sorting

> This lists files sorted by when they were last accessed, newest first.

---

## üîπ **9. Copy the file /var/log/bootstrap.log to your current directory**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `cp` command to copy a file from its source path to the current directory.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cp /var/log/bootstrap.log .
```

To verify:

```bash
ls
```

You should see `bootstrap.log` in your current directory.

---

## üß† Bonus Tips

- Use tab completion to avoid typing full paths:
  ```bash
  cp /va<TAB>/lo<TAB>/boo<TAB> .
  ```
- Combine `ls` options for better readability:
  ```bash
  ls -lh
  ```
- Use `rm -i` when unsure:
  ```bash
  rm -i *.tmp
  ```

---

Great job completing these hands-on exercises! You're now comfortable with basic file and directory management in Linux.

---

### üîí **Security: Managing File Permissions and Ownership ‚Äì Summary & Guide**

In this reading, you learned how to manage **file permissions** and **ownership** in Linux ‚Äî a crucial skill for protecting sensitive data and ensuring system security.

---

## üéØ **Learning Objectives Recap**

By the end of this section, you should be able to:

- Explain file ownership and permissions
- View file and directory permissions
- Make files private by changing permission settings

---

## üîê Why File Permissions Matter

Linux is a **multi-user operating system**, which means multiple people can access the same machine. Without proper permissions:

- Anyone could **read or modify your files**
- Malicious users might **execute harmful scripts**
- Sensitive documents (like tax records or company IP) could be **exposed**

That‚Äôs why **permissions and ownership** allow fine-grained control over who can read, write, or execute files.

---

## üë§ Types of Owners in Linux

There are **three categories** of users that determine permission levels:

| Category      | Meaning                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **user (u)**  | The owner of the file (usually the creator) |
| **group (g)** | A group of users assigned to the file       |
| **other (o)** | Everyone else with access to the system     |

Each category has its own set of permissions:

- `r` = Read
- `w` = Write
- `x` = Execute

---

## üëÄ Viewing File Permissions

Use:

```bash
ls -l filename
```

Example output:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 theia users 25 Dec 22 17:47 my_new_file
```

- `-`: Indicates it's a regular file
- `rw-`: User (owner) permissions
- `r--`: Group permissions
- `r--`: Others' permissions

üìò For directories:

- `d` at the start indicates it's a directory
- Permissions mean:
  - `r`: Can list contents (`ls`)
  - `w`: Can create or delete files inside
  - `x`: Can enter the directory (`cd`)

---

## üîß Changing File Permissions with `chmod`

You can change permissions using:

```bash
chmod [options] filename
```

### Example: Make a file private

```bash
chmod go-r my_new_file
```

This removes **read** permission for **group** and **others**.

After running:

```bash
ls -l my_new_file
```

You'll see:

```
-rw------- 1 theia users 24 Dec 22 18:49 my_new_file
```

Now only the **owner** can read and write to the file.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only the **owner** or **root** can change permissions on a file.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Common `chmod` Syntax Options

| Command               | Action                                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `chmod u+x file.sh`   | Add execute permission for the user          |
| `chmod go-w file.txt` | Remove write permission for group and others |
| `chmod 755 file.sh`   | Set numeric permissions (see below)          |

### Numeric Permission Notation

Each permission level has a number value:

- `r` = 4
- `w` = 2
- `x` = 1

Sum them to get numeric values:

| Permission | Value |
| ---------- | ----- |
| `rwx`      | 7     |
| `rw-`      | 6     |
| `r-x`      | 5     |
| `r--`      | 4     |

Example:

```bash
chmod 600 secret.txt
```

Only the owner has **read and write** access.

---

## üìÅ Executable Files and Shell Scripts

To make a shell script executable:

1. Add a **shebang** line at the top:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   ```
2. Give it execute permission:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
   ```
3. Run it:
   ```bash
   ./script.sh
   ```

This tells the OS that the file is a program written in Bash (or another interpreter).

---

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Concept                | Description                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **User (u)**           | Owner of the file                              |
| **Group (g)**          | Group of users who share ownership             |
| **Other (o)**          | All other users                                |
| **Permissions**        | `r` = read, `w` = write, `x` = execute         |
| **View Permissions**   | `ls -l`                                        |
| **Change Permissions** | `chmod`                                        |
| **Make Private**       | `chmod go-rwx filename`                        |
| **Numeric Mode**       | `chmod 600 filename`                           |
| **Directories**        | `r` = list, `w` = modify contents, `x` = enter |

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Use `chmod 700 folder` to keep a directory private
- Protect sensitive scripts with `chmod 600 script.sh`
- Use `id` to see what groups you belong to
- Use `chown` (as root) to change file ownership

---

You're now equipped with the knowledge to **secure your files**, **control access**, and **protect sensitive data** in a Linux environment.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Exercise 1 - Viewing and Modifying File Access Permissions

In this exercise, you learned how to **view** and **modify file permissions** in Linux using the `ls -l` and `chmod` commands. Understanding and managing permissions is essential for maintaining system security and controlling access to your files.

---

## üìÅ 1.1 View File Access Permissions

### üîß Steps:

1. Navigate to your project directory:

   ```bash
   cd /home/project
   ```

2. Download the required file:

   ```bash
   wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-LX0117EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/module%201/usdoi.txt
   ```

3. View the file's permissions:
   ```bash
   ls -l usdoi.txt
   ```

### ‚úÖ Sample Output:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 theia theia 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

### üìù Breakdown of Permission String: `-rw-r--r--`

| Part  | Meaning                                       |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `-`   | It's a regular file (use `d` for directories) |
| `rw-` | User (owner) has **read** and **write**       |
| `r--` | Group has only **read**                       |
| `r--` | Others have only **read**                     |

---

## üîê 1.2 Change File Access Permissions with `chmod`

The `chmod` command allows you to modify who can **read**, **write**, or **execute** a file.

### üîß Syntax:

```bash
chmod [who][operator][permission] filename
```

| Component    | Values                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `who`        | `u` = user, `g` = group, `o` = others, `a` = all |
| `operator`   | `+` = add, `-` = remove, `=` = set exactly       |
| `permission` | `r` = read, `w` = write, `x` = execute           |

---

### üîç Example Commands

#### ‚ùå Remove read permission for all users:

```bash
chmod -r usdoi.txt
```

Verify:

```bash
ls -l usdoi.txt
```

You'll see something like:

```
--w------- 1 theia theia 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

#### ‚úÖ Restore read permission for all users:

```bash
chmod +r usdoi.txt
```

Verify:

```bash
ls -l usdoi.txt
```

You should return to:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 theia theia 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

#### üö´ Remove read permission only for "other":

```bash
chmod o-r usdoi.txt
```

Verify:

```bash
ls -l usdoi.txt
```

Now output will be:

```
-rw-r----- 1 theia theia 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

Only **user** and **group** can read the file now.

| Add read to all                         | `chmod +r filename`  |
| Remove read from others                 | `chmod o-r filename` |
| Add execute to user                     | `chmod u+x filename` |
| Set exact permissions (e.g., rw-------) | `chmod 600 filename` |

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Use **numeric mode** for precision:
  ```bash
  chmod 644 usdoi.txt    # rw-r--r--
  chmod 700 secret.sh     # rwx------
  ```
- Always double-check permissions on sensitive files:
  ```bash
  ls -l secret.txt
  ```
- Only the **file owner** or **root** can change permissions.

---

Great job completing this exercise! You're now able to view and manage file permissions ‚Äî an essential skill for working securely in Linux.

---

### üìÅ Exercise 2 - Understanding Directory Access Permissions

In this exercise, you explored how **directory permissions** in Linux work and how they differ from file permissions. You learned that **execute (`x`) permission is required to enter a directory**, and **write (`w`) permission is needed to create or delete files inside it**.

---

## üîç Summary of What You Learned

| Permission    | Meaning for Directories                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `r` (read)    | Allows listing contents with `ls`        |
| `w` (write)   | Allows adding/removing files             |
| `x` (execute) | Allows entering the directory using `cd` |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Even if you have write access, you can't modify contents without execute permission!

---

## üßæ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 2.1 View Default Directory Access Permissions

#### Create a new directory:

```bash
cd /home/project
mkdir test
```

#### Check its permissions:

```bash
ls -l
```

Output example:

```
drwxr-sr-x 2 theia users 4096 May 15 14:06 test
```

- `d`: Indicates it's a directory
- `rwx`: Owner (user) has read, write, and execute
- `r-s`: Group has read and setgid (special permission)
- `r-x`: Others have read and execute

You verified that:

- You could enter the directory
- You could create a subdirectory inside it

Commands used:

```bash
cd test
mkdir test2
cd ..
```

> üí° The `s` in group permissions is a special flag called **setgid** ‚Äî it ensures new files inherit the group of the parent directory.

---

### üîπ 2.2 Remove User Execute Permissions

#### Remove execute permission for owner:

```bash
chmod u-x test
```

Now try:

```bash
cd test
```

‚ùå Output:

```
bash: cd: test: Permission denied
```

Even though you still have read and write permissions, **you can't enter the directory** without execute permission.

Try listing contents:

```bash
ls -l test
```

‚úÖ Works ‚Äî because you still have **read** permission.

Try creating a subdirectory:

```bash
mkdir test/test3
```

‚ùå Fails ‚Äî because **write requires execute**.

---

### üîÅ Restore Permissions

#### Add back execute:

```bash
chmod u+x test
```

#### Remove write:

```bash
chmod u-w test
```

Check current permissions:

```bash
ls -l
```

Now try:

```bash
cd test
mkdir test_again
```

‚ùå Output:

```
mkdir: cannot create directory ‚Äòtest_again‚Äô: Permission denied
```

You can **enter** the directory (thanks to `x`), but you **can't modify** it (because you don‚Äôt have `w`).

---

## üß† Key Takeaways

| Scenario               | Required Permission                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| List contents (`ls`)   | `r`                                             |
| Enter directory (`cd`) | `x`                                             |
| Create/delete files    | `w` + `x`                                       |
| Rename or move files   | `w` + `x` in both source and target directories |

> üß© Think of `x` as a key to open a door ‚Äî you need it before you can do anything useful inside a directory.

| Command            | Effect                                                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ls -l`            | Show directory permissions                                |
| `chmod u+x dir`    | Allow user to enter directory                             |
| `chmod u-w dir`    | Prevent user from modifying directory contents            |
| `cd dir`           | Requires execute (`x`) permission                         |
| `ls dir`           | Requires read (`r`) permission                            |
| `mkdir dir/subdir` | Requires write (`w`) + execute (`x`) permissions on `dir` |

You've now mastered how **directory permissions** control access differently than file permissions ‚Äî an essential concept for securing and managing your Linux system effectively.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Practice Exercises ‚Äì File and Directory Permissions**

Here are the **practice exercises** with hints and full solutions to help you reinforce your understanding of Linux file and directory permissions.

---

## üîπ **1. List the permissions set for the file `usdoi.txt`**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `ls -l` command to view file permissions.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
ls -l usdoi.txt
```

Example output:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 theia users 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

This shows that:

- The owner has **read and write**
- The group has **read**
- Others have **read**

---

## üîπ **2. Revoke the write permission on `usdoi.txt` for the user, and verify**

### üí° Hint:

Use `chmod u-w` to remove write access for the user.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
chmod u-w usdoi.txt
ls -l usdoi.txt
```

New output:

```
-r--r--r-- 1 theia users 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt
```

The user (owner) no longer has **write** permission.

---

## üîπ **3. What happens if you try to delete `usdoi.txt` after revoking write permissions?**

### üí° Hint:

You don‚Äôt need write permission to delete a file ‚Äî but you **do** need write permission in the **directory** it‚Äôs in.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

Try deleting:

```bash
rm usdoi.txt
```

‚úÖ It works!  
Even though you removed write permission **on the file**, you can still delete it because:

- You own the file
- You have **write permission in the directory**

> üîç Note: If you didn‚Äôt own the file, you could still delete it as long as:
>
> - You had **write** permission in the directory
> - You didn't own the file

---

## üîπ **4. Create a new directory called `tmp_dir` in your home directory**

### üí° Hint:

Use the `mkdir` command.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir tmp_dir
```

Now you have a new directory in your home folder.

---

## üîπ **5. View the permissions of the newly created directory `tmp_dir`**

### üí° Hint:

Use `ls -l` again to see directory permissions.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
ls -l
```

Output will include something like:

```
drwxr-xr-x 2 theia users 4096 Apr 5 10:00 tmp_dir
```

This means:

- User: read, write, execute
- Group: read, execute
- Others: read, execute

---

## üîπ **6. Revoke the user write permission for `tmp_dir`**

### üí° Hint:

Use `chmod u-w` on the directory.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
chmod u-w tmp_dir
ls -l
```

New output:

```
dr-xr-xr-x 2 theia users 4096 Apr 5 10:00 tmp_dir
```

User now only has **execute** and **read** ‚Äî not **write**.

---

## üîπ **7. Check whether you can create a subdirectory `sub_dir` inside `tmp_dir`**

### üí° Hint:

Use `mkdir` to attempt creating a subdirectory.

### ‚úÖ Solution 1:

```bash
mkdir tmp_dir/sub_dir
```

‚ùå Output:

```
mkdir: cannot create directory ‚Äòtmp_dir/sub_dir‚Äô: Permission denied
```

### ‚úÖ Solution 2 Explanation:

Even though you have **execute** (`x`) permission on `tmp_dir`, which allows you to **enter** the directory, you **don‚Äôt have write** (`w`) permission ‚Äî so you **can't modify** its contents (like creating or deleting files or directories).

# **Viewing File Content in Linux**

---

## **1. Introduction**

‚úÖ Displaying full or partial contents of a file  
‚úÖ Navigating large files page-by-page  
‚úÖ Counting lines, words, and characters

These tools are especially useful when working with log files, scripts, configuration files, and other text-based data.

---

## **2. Commands to View File Contents**

### **A. `cat` ‚Äì Concatenate and Print Entire File**

- **Purpose**: Print the entire contents of a file to the terminal.
- **Syntax**:

  ```bash
  cat <filename>
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  cat numbers.txt
  ```

> Outputs all lines from the file `numbers.txt`, from line 0 to 99 in this example.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Small files that fit on one screen.
  - Combining multiple files into one (e.g., `cat file1 file2 > combined.txt`)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Not ideal for long files ‚Äî output may scroll off-screen quickly.

---

### **B. `more` ‚Äì View File One Page at a Time**

- **Purpose**: Scroll through a file page by page.
- **Syntax**:

  ```bash
  more <filename>
  ```

- **Example**:

  ```bash
  more numbers.txt
  ```

- **Navigation Keys**:
  - Press **Spacebar** to go to the next page.
  - Press **Enter** to scroll one line at a time.
  - Press **q** to quit and return to the command prompt.

> Ideal for reading long files without overwhelming the terminal.

---

### **C. `head` ‚Äì View First Few Lines of a File**

- **Purpose**: Show the beginning portion of a file.
- **Syntax**:

  ```bash
  head <filename>
  ```

- **Default Behavior**:

  - Displays **first 10 lines** of the file.

- **Example**:

  ```bash
  head numbers.txt
  ```

  > Shows lines 0‚Äì9

- **Custom Line Count**:
  ```bash
  head -n 3 numbers.txt
  ```
  > Shows first 3 lines: 0, 1, 2

> Useful for checking headers, logs, or sample data quickly.

---

### **D. `tail` ‚Äì View Last Few Lines of a File**

- **Purpose**: Show the end portion of a file.
- **Syntax**:

  ```bash
  tail <filename>
  ```

- **Default Behavior**:

  - Displays **last 10 lines** of the file.

- **Example**:

  ```bash
  tail numbers.txt
  ```

  > Shows lines 90‚Äì99

- **Custom Line Count**:

  ```bash
  tail -n 3 numbers.txt
  ```

  > Shows last 3 lines: 97, 98, 99

- **Real-world Use**:
  - Monitoring log files in real-time using:
    ```bash
    tail -f /var/log/syslog
    ```

---

## **3. Command to Analyze File Content: `wc`**

### **A. `wc` ‚Äì Word Count**

- **Purpose**: Count **lines**, **words**, and **bytes (characters)** in a file.
- **Syntax**:

  ```bash
  wc <filename>
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  wc pets.txt
  ```

> Output:

```
7 7 28 pets.txt
```

- **Meaning**:
  - **7 lines**
  - **7 words**
  - **28 characters** (including newline characters)

> The character count is higher than expected because `wc` counts **newline characters** (`\n`) as well.

---

### **B. Options for Specific Counts**

| Option | Description                                | Example                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `-l`   | Count only lines                           | `wc -l pets.txt` ‚Üí `7 pets.txt`  |
| `-w`   | Count only words                           | `wc -w pets.txt` ‚Üí `7 pets.txt`  |
| `-c`   | Count only characters (including newlines) | `wc -c pets.txt` ‚Üí `28 pets.txt` |

> These options let you extract specific metrics without extra parsing.

  cat pets.txt | wc -l
  ```

---

# **Useful Commands for Wrangling Text Files in Linux**

---

## **1. Introduction**

‚úÖ Sorting lines alphabetically  
‚úÖ Removing duplicates  
‚úÖ Searching for patterns  
‚úÖ Extracting parts of lines  
‚úÖ Merging lines from multiple files

These tools are essential for working with log files, CSV data, configuration files, and more.

---

## **2. Sorting File Content: `sort` Command**

### **Purpose**

Sort the lines of a file **alphabetically or numerically**.

### **Basic Syntax**

```bash
sort <filename>
```

### **Examples**

- Sort file alphabetically:

  ```bash
  sort pets.txt
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  cat
  cat
  cat
  cat
  cat
  dog
  dog
  ```

- Sort in reverse order:
  ```bash
  sort -r pets.txt
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  dog
  dog
  cat
  cat
  cat
  cat
  cat
  ```

> Tip: Use `sort -n` for numeric sorting if your file contains numbers.

---

## **3. Removing Duplicate Lines: `uniq` Command**

### **Purpose**

Filter out **consecutive duplicate lines** in a file.

### **Basic Syntax**

```bash
uniq <filename>
```

### **Example**

Given this content in `pets.txt`:

```
cat
dog
dog
cat
```

Running:

```bash
uniq pets.txt
```

Output:

```
cat
dog
cat
```

> Note: `uniq` only removes **duplicates that appear one after another**. To remove all duplicates regardless of position, first use `sort`, then `uniq`:

```bash
sort pets.txt | uniq
```

---

## **4. Searching for Patterns: `grep` Command**

### **Purpose**

Search for lines containing a specific **pattern** (e.g., word, phrase, regular expression).

### **Basic Syntax**

```bash
grep "pattern" <filename>
```

### **Examples**

- Search for lines containing "ch":

  ```bash
  grep "ch" people.txt
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  Dennis Ritchie
  Erwin Schrodinger
  ```

- Case-insensitive search:

  ```bash
  grep -i "ch" people.txt
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  Charles Babbage
  Dennis Ritchie
  Erwin Schrodinger
  ```

> `grep` supports regular expressions for advanced searches:

```bash
grep "^C" people.txt   # Find names starting with 'C'
```

---

## **5. Extracting Parts of Lines: `cut` Command**

### **Purpose**

Extract specific **characters or fields** from each line of a file.

### **Basic Syntax**

```bash
cut [options] <filename>
```

### **A. Character-Based Extraction**

- Extract characters 2 through 9:

  ```bash
  cut -c2-9 people.txt
  ```

  Example Input:

  ```
  Alan Turing
  Charles Babbage
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  lan Turin
  harles B
  ```

### **B. Field-Based Extraction**

Use `-d` to define a delimiter and `-f` to select a field.

- Extract last names (second field) from a space-separated file:

  ```bash
  cut -d' ' -f2 people.txt
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  Turing
  Babbage
  ```

> You can also extract multiple fields:

```bash
cut -d',' -f1,3 csvfile.csv
```

---

## **6. Merging Lines from Multiple Files: `paste` Command**

### **Purpose**

Combine lines from multiple files **side by side**, similar to columns in a table.

### **Basic Syntax**

```bash
paste <file1> <file2> <file3>
```

### **Example**

You have three files:

- `first.txt`:

  ```
  Alan
  Charles
  Dennis
  ```

- `last.txt`:

  ```
  Turing
  Babbage
  Ritchie
  ```

- `yob.txt`:
  ```
  1912
  1791
  1941
  ```

Run:

```bash
paste first.txt last.txt yob.txt
```

Output:

```
Alan    Turing    1912
Charles Babbage   1791
Dennis  Ritchie   1941
```

> By default, `paste` uses **tab** as the delimiter.

### **Custom Delimiter**

To use a comma instead:

```bash
paste -d',' first.txt last.txt yob.txt
```

Output:

```
Alan,Turing,1912
Charles,Babbage,1791
Dennis,Ritchie,1941
```

---

## **8. Final Tips**

- Combine commands using pipes (`|`) for powerful workflows:
  ```bash
  sort pets.txt | uniq
  ```
- Use `grep` with wildcards or regex for flexible searching.
- `cut` is great for parsing structured text like CSV or logs.
- `paste` helps you create reports or combine related datasets.

# üìÑ Exercise 1 - Viewing File Contents with `cat`, `more`, and `less`

In this exercise, you learned how to **view and navigate file contents** in the terminal using three essential Linux commands:

- `cat` ‚Äì for quick viewing and concatenation
- `more` ‚Äì for basic scrolling through a file
- `less` ‚Äì for advanced navigation (forward and backward)

These tools are especially useful when working with shell scripts, logs, configuration files, and other text-based data.

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üèÅ Start by navigating to your home directory:

```bash
cd ~
```

### üîç Check what files exist:

```bash
ls
```

You should see a file named `entrypoint.sh`. `.sh` is the extension used for **shell scripts**, which are executable text files that contain Bash commands.

---

## ‚úÖ 1.1 View File Content with `cat`

### Command:

```bash
cat entrypoint.sh
```

### What It Does:

- Displays the **entire contents** of the file at once
- Stops at the end and returns to the command prompt

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If the file is longer than your terminal window, you‚Äôll only see the last part ‚Äî it scrolls past too quickly to read everything.

### üí° Use Cases:

- Quick inspection of small files
- Concatenating multiple files:
  ```bash
  cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt
  ```

---

## ‚úÖ 1.2 View File Content with `more`

### Command:

```bash
more entrypoint.sh
```

### What It Does:

- Shows one screen of text at a time
- Press **Spacebar** to go to the next page
- Type **q** to quit

### üîç Useful Info:

The first line:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

is called a **shebang** ‚Äî it tells the system to use `/bin/bash` to interpret the script.

> üìå You‚Äôll learn more about writing shell scripts later in the course.

### üí° Use Cases:

- Reading medium-sized files
- Viewing logs or configuration files from the command line

---

## ‚úÖ 1.3 Scroll Through File Content with `less`

### Command:

```bash
less entrypoint.sh
```

### What It Does:

- Displays one screen of content
- Allows **scrolling forward and backward**
  - **‚Üë / ‚Üì** keys: scroll line by line
  - **Page Up / Page Down**: scroll page by page
- Press **q** to exit

### üÜï Why `less` Is Better Than `more`:

- You can move **up and down**, not just down
- You can search inside the file with `/search_term`
- It doesn‚Äôt automatically quit at the end

---

## üìã Summary Table

| Command | Scrolling Direction   | Interactive | Exits Automatically | Best For                  |
| ------- | --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |

# üìÑ Exercise 2 - Viewing Text File Contents

## Using `head` and `tail` to View File Content

In this exercise, you learned how to **inspect specific parts of a text file** using two powerful Linux commands:

- `head` ‚Äì to view the **beginning** of a file
- `tail` ‚Äì to view the **end** of a file

These tools are especially useful for:

- Reading large log files
- Monitoring real-time updates (with `tail -f`)
- Extracting headers or footers from data files

---

## üßæ Step-by-Step Instructions

### üîß Download and Navigate to Your Project Directory:

```bash
cd /home/project
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0250EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Bash%20Scripting/usdoi.txt
```

Verify the file was downloaded:

```bash
ls
```

You should see `usdoi.txt` listed.

---

## ‚úÖ 2.1 Display the First N Lines with `head`

### Show the first 10 lines (default):

```bash
head usdoi.txt
```

This is helpful when viewing large documents like logs or configuration files where the most important info may be at the top.

### Show only the first 3 lines:

```bash
head -3 usdoi.txt
```

Example output:

```
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another...
```

> üí° Use `head` to quickly preview files without opening the entire contents.

---

## ‚úÖ 2.2 Display the Last N Lines with `tail`

### Show the last 10 lines (default):

```bash
tail usdoi.txt
```

Useful for checking the end of logs or files where recent changes are appended.

### Show only the last 2 lines:

```bash
tail -2 usdoi.txt
```

Example output:

```
...and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.
```

> üöÄ Pro Tip: Use `tail -f` to follow a log file in real time:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

# üìä Exercise 3 - Getting Basic Text File Stats with `wc`

In this exercise, you learned how to use the **`wc`** (word count) command to get basic statistics about a text file ‚Äî including the number of **lines**, **words**, and **characters**.

This is especially useful when:

- You're analyzing large text files
- You need to verify file contents before processing
- You're writing scripts that depend on file size or structure

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Breakdown

### Start by navigating to your project directory and using `wc`:

```bash
cd /home/project
wc usdoi.txt
```

### Example Output:

```
     21     268    1654 usdoi.txt
```

The output shows:

1. Number of **lines**
2. Number of **words**
3. Number of **characters**
4. File name

---

## ‚úÖ View Specific Stats

### üî¢ Count Lines Only:

```bash
wc -l usdoi.txt
```

Useful for checking how many entries are in a list or log file.

---

### üìù Count Words Only:

```bash
wc -w usdoi.txt
```

Great for content analysis or verifying document length.

---

### üî§ Count Characters Only:

```bash
wc -c usdoi.txt
```

Tells you the total byte size of the file ‚Äî useful for storage and transmission planning.

> üí° Note: `wc -c` counts bytes, not just visible characters ‚Äî so whitespace and punctuation are included.

---

## üìã Summary Table

| Command          | Output                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `wc filename`    | Lines, words, characters     |
| `wc -l filename` | Number of lines              |
| `wc -w filename` | Number of words              |
| `wc -c filename` | Number of bytes (characters) |

---

## üß† Why `wc` Is Useful

- **Analysis**: Get quick stats without opening the file
- **Debugging**: Check if a file has expected content structure

---

## You're doing great! With these tools, you can now **analyze text files efficiently** and extract meaningful insights from their content.

# üßπ Exercise 4 - Basic Text Wrangling: Sorting Lines and Dropping Duplicates

In this exercise, you learned how to **clean up and organize text data** using two powerful Linux utilities:

- `sort` ‚Äì to **alphabetically or numerically sort lines**
- `uniq` ‚Äì to **remove consecutive duplicate lines**

These tools are essential for:

- Data cleaning
- Log file analysis
- Preparing input for scripts
- Removing redundant output

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Breakdown

### ‚úÖ 4.1 Sort Lines Alphanumerically with `sort`

#### Display the lines of `usdoi.txt` sorted alphanumerically:

```bash
sort usdoi.txt
```

This command rearranges all the lines in alphabetical order (A‚ÄìZ), making it easier to scan or analyze content.

#### Sort in reverse order (Z‚ÄìA):

```bash
sort -r usdoi.txt
```

> üí° This is useful when you want to see the "end" of an alphabetized list first ‚Äî like viewing the latest entries in a log.

---

### ‚úÖ 4.2 Remove Consecutive Duplicate Lines with `uniq`

#### First, download a new file:

```bash
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-LX0117EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/module%201/zoo.txt
```

#### View the contents:

```bash
cat zoo.txt
```

You‚Äôll notice some repeated animal names, especially `zebra`.

#### Remove **consecutive duplicates**:

```bash
uniq zoo.txt
```

This removes only lines that appear **one after another**, so:

```
zebra
zebra
lion
tiger
zebra
```

Becomes:

```
zebra
lion
tiger
zebra
```

Only the **first two zebras** are removed as duplicates ‚Äî the last one stays because it's not directly after another zebra.

---

## üìã Summary Table

| Command            | Description                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `sort filename`    | Sort lines alphabetically              |
| `sort -r filename` | Sort lines in reverse order            |
| `uniq filename`    | Remove **consecutive** duplicate lines |
| `sort file         | uniq`                                  | Sort then remove all duplicates (if grouped) |

---

## üß† Pro Tips

- To remove **all duplicate lines** regardless of order:

  ```bash
  sort zoo.txt | uniq
  ```

- Count how many times each line appears:

  ```bash
  sort zoo.txt | uniq -c
  ```

- Show only lines that appear **more than once**:

  ```bash
  sort zoo.txt | uniq -d
  ```

- Show only lines that appear **exactly once**:
  ```bash
  sort zoo.txt | uniq -u
  ```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Use Cases

| Find most frequently visited URLs | `awk '{print $7}' access.log | sort                     | uniq -c  | sort -nr | head -n 10` |

---

## Great job mastering these basic but powerful text processing tools! You're now equipped to **organize**, **clean**, and **analyze** textual data efficiently in Linux.

# üß© Exercise 5 - Basic Text Wrangling: Extracting Lines and Fields

In this exercise, you learned how to **filter lines** using patterns with `grep` and **extract specific parts of text** using the `cut` command.

These tools are essential for:

- Searching through logs
- Filtering data
- Processing structured files like CSVs
- Automating repetitive tasks in scripts

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Breakdown

### ‚úÖ 5.1 Extract Lines Matching a Pattern with `grep`

#### Print all lines containing the word "people":

```bash
grep people usdoi.txt
```

This shows only the lines where the word `people` appears.

#### Print matching lines along with line numbers:

```bash
grep -n people usdoi.txt
```

#### Count how many lines contain the pattern:

```bash
grep -c people usdoi.txt
```

#### Ignore case (match both "People" and "people"):

```bash
grep -i people usdoi.txt
```

#### Show lines that **do not** contain the pattern:

```bash
grep -v login /etc/passwd
```

Useful for filtering out system-generated accounts from `/etc/passwd`.

#### Match only whole words:

```bash
grep -w people usdoi.txt
```

Prevents partial matches like `peoples` or `unpeople`.

---

### ‚úÖ 5.2 Extract Fields from Lines Using `cut`

#### View first two characters of each line in `zoo.txt`:

```bash
cut -c -2 zoo.txt
```

#### View text starting from the second character:

```bash
cut -c 2- zoo.txt
```

> These options extract by **character position**, useful for fixed-width formats.

---

### üì• Work with Delimited Files (e.g., CSV)

#### Download and view the file:

```bash
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-LX0117EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/v4_new_content/labs/names_and_numbers.csv
cat names_and_numbers.csv
```

Sample content:

```
Name,Phone
Alice,555-1234
Bob,555-5678
Charlie,555-9012
```

#### Extract just the phone numbers (second field):

```bash
cut -d "," -f2 names_and_numbers.csv
```

- `-d ","` tells `cut` to split on commas
- `-f2` tells it to return the second field

Output:

```
Phone
555-1234
555-5678
555-9012
```

You can also extract multiple fields:

```bash
cut -d "," -f1,3 names_and_numbers.csv
```

Returns fields 1 and 3 ‚Äî useful when skipping unnecessary columns.

# üß© Exercise 6 - Basic Text Wrangling: Merging Lines as Fields

In this exercise, you learned how to use the **`paste`** command to **merge lines from multiple files side-by-side**, like combining columns in a spreadsheet.

This is especially useful when:

- You're working with related data stored in separate files
- You want to align rows for analysis or reporting
- You need to build structured output from flat files

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Breakdown

### ‚úÖ Download an additional file:

```bash
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-LX0117EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/module%201/zoo_ages.txt
```

You already have `zoo.txt`, which contains animal names. Now `zoo_ages.txt` has corresponding age data.

### ‚úÖ Merge both files line-by-line using `paste`:

```bash
paste zoo.txt zoo_ages.txt
```

By default, `paste` uses a **Tab (`\t`)** character to separate merged fields.

Example Output:

```
lion	5
tiger	4
zebra	6
elephant	10
```

This makes it easy to combine related data into a single view.

---

### ‚úÖ Change the Delimiter to Comma (`,`) for CSV-like Output:

```bash
paste -d "," zoo.txt zoo_ages.txt
```

Now the output looks like:

```
lion,5
tiger,4
zebra,6
elephant,10
```

> üí° This is useful for creating CSV files or preparing data for scripts and databases.

You can also use other delimiters like space, colon, or semicolon:

```bash
paste -d " " zoo.txt zoo_ages.txt   # Space
paste -d ":" zoo.txt zoo_ages.txt  # Colon
```

# üõ†Ô∏è **Practice Exercises ‚Äì Text Processing in Linux**

These hands-on exercises help reinforce your knowledge of **file inspection**, **searching**, and **text manipulation** using essential Linux commands like `wc`, `grep`, `head`, `tail`, `cut`, and more.

---

## üîß Before You Begin

Make sure you're in your home directory:

```bash
cd ~
pwd
```

---

## üìù Practice Exercise Solutions

### 1. **Display the number of lines in `/etc/passwd`**

#### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
wc -l /etc/passwd
```

This shows how many user accounts exist on the system (each line in `/etc/passwd` represents a user).

---

### 2. **Display lines containing "not installed" in `/var/log/bootstrap.log`**

#### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
grep "not installed" /var/log/bootstrap.log
```

This helps identify packages or services that failed to install during system boot.

---

### 3. **Find websites with "org" in them from `top-sites.txt`**

#### First, download the file:

```bash
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0250EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Bash%20Scripting/top-sites.txt
```

#### ‚úÖ Use `grep` to search for "org":

```bash
grep "org" top-sites.txt
```

This lists all URLs or domains that include "org".

#### üîÑ Alternative solution using case-insensitive match:

```bash
grep -i "org" top-sites.txt
```

Useful if you want to catch both "org" and "ORG", etc.

---

### 4. **Print the first 7 lines of `top-sites.txt`**

#### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
head -7 top-sites.txt
```

This gives a quick preview of the top sites list.

---

### 5. **Print the last 7 lines of `top-sites.txt`**

#### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
tail -7 top-sites.txt
```

Handy when you're interested in newer entries at the end of a list or log file.

---

### 6. **Print the first three characters of each line from `top-sites.txt`**

#### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cut -c -3 top-sites.txt
```

This extracts only the first 3 characters from every line ‚Äî useful for fixed-width data or codes.

---

### 7. **Extract and view only the names from `names_and_numbers.csv`**

Assuming the file already exists:

```bash
cat names_and_numbers.csv
```

#### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
cut -d "," -f1 names_and_numbers.csv
```

- `-d ","` tells `cut` to use comma as the delimiter
- `-f1` selects the **first field** ‚Äî which is the name column

You can also skip the header if needed:

```bash
tail -n +2 names_and_numbers.csv | cut -d "," -f1
```

## üß† Why These Skills Matter

You now have the tools to:

- **Analyze logs**
- **Filter and extract data**
- **Process CSVs and structured files**
- **Build automation pipelines** using command-line tools

These are foundational skills for scripting, system administration, and data analysis in Linux.

---

## **Exercise 7 ‚Äì Combining Commands with Pipes and Redirection**

In this exercise, you‚Äôll learn how to:

- Combine multiple Linux commands using **pipes (`|`)**
- Redirect command output to files using `>` and `>>`
- Use input redirection with `<`
- Build powerful **command pipelines** that process data step-by-step

These skills are essential for:

- Automating repetitive tasks
- Processing logs or large datasets
- Writing shell scripts
- Becoming a more efficient Linux user

---

## üîß What is Piping?

The **pipe operator (`|`)** takes the **output of one command** and feeds it as **input to another**.

This lets you chain together small tools to build complex operations.

### Example:

```bash
ls -l | grep "Jan" | wc -l
```

This pipeline:

1. Lists all files (`ls -l`)
2. Filters only those modified in January (`grep "Jan"`)
3. Counts them (`wc -l`)

---

## üì• Input and Output Redirection

You can also control where input comes from and where output goes using:

| Operator | Purpose                                | Example                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `>`      | Redirect output to a file (overwrites) | `ls > files.txt`               |
| `>>`     | Append output to a file                | `echo "New line" >> files.txt` |
| `<`      | Redirect input from a file             | `sort < names.txt`             |

### Example:

```bash
grep "error" /var/log/syslog > errors.txt
```

Saves all lines containing "error" from the system log into a new file.

---

## üí° Hands-On Practice

Let‚Äôs go through some guided examples.

### ‚úÖ 1. Chain `grep`, `sort`, and `uniq` to Analyze Log Data

#### Find unique IP addresses in an access log:

```bash
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $9}' | sort | uniq
```

- `grep`: filters for failed login attempts
- `awk`: extracts the IP address field
- `sort`: prepares for deduplication
- `uniq`: removes duplicates

> You'll learn about `awk` soon ‚Äî it's a powerful text processing tool.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Save Command Output to a File

#### Save your list of running processes to a file:

```bash
ps -e > process_list.txt
```

Now view it:

```bash
cat process_list.txt
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Count Words in a File Using a Pipeline

#### Count how many times each word appears in `usdoi.txt`:

```bash
tr ' ' '\n' < usdoi.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

What this does:

- `tr ' ' '\n'`: replaces spaces with newlines (puts each word on its own line)
- `sort`: sorts words alphabetically
- `uniq -c`: counts occurrences
- `sort -nr`: sorts numerically in reverse order

---

### ‚úÖ 4. View Command Output One Page at a Time

Sometimes output fills your screen. Use `less` to page through it:

```bash
history | less
```

Use ‚Üë ‚Üì keys to scroll, and press `q` to quit.

---

| ------------------------------ | --------------------- | --------- |
| Pipe output to another command | `command1             | command2` |
| Redirect output to a file      | `command > file.txt`  |
| Append output to a file        | `command >> file.txt` |
| Read input from a file         | `command < file.txt`  |

---

## üß† Why This Matters

With pipes and redirection, you can:

- **Automate workflows** with simple, reusable components
- **Process large amounts of data** efficiently
- **Build custom scripts** that do exactly what you need

---

> üí° Many devices can switch roles ‚Äî acting as both client and server when needed.

---

### üì¶ Packets and Pings

#### What Is a Network Packet?

- A packet is a **formatted unit of data** sent over a network.
- Contains:
  - **Control information**: source, destination, routing info
  - **Payload**: actual data being transmitted

#### What Is `ping`?

- A utility used to test connectivity between two hosts
- Works by sending an **"echo request"** packet and waiting for a response
- Helps diagnose connection issues (e.g., "Can I reach Google's servers?")

Example command:

```bash
ping google.com
```

---

### üåç URLs and IP Addresses

## **Exercise 4 ‚Äì Exploring DNS and Looking Up Domain Information**

In this exercise, you'll learn how to:

- Understand what **DNS** is and why it matters
- Use `nslookup` and `dig` to look up domain information
- Check **IP addresses**, **name servers**, and **mail servers** associated with a domain

These tools are essential for:

- Troubleshooting domain issues
- Checking website availability
- Understanding how domains resolve to IP addresses
- Debugging email delivery problems using MX records

---

## üåê What Is DNS?

**DNS (Domain Name System)** is like the phonebook of the internet.

It maps **human-readable domain names** (like `google.com`) to **machine-readable IP addresses** (like `172.217.174.78`), so your computer knows where to find a website or service.

### Key DNS Concepts:

| Term            | Meaning                                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **A Record**    | Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address              |
| **AAAA Record** | Maps a domain to an IPv6 address                   |
| **CNAME**       | Alias record pointing one domain to another        |
| **MX Record**   | Specifies mail servers for a domain                |
| **NS Record**   | Identifies authoritative name servers for a domain |

---

## üîç Step-by-Step: Using `nslookup`

The `nslookup` command helps you query DNS servers to get domain-related information.

### ‚úÖ View Basic DNS Info for a Website

```bash
nslookup google.com
```

This shows:

- The **IP address** of the domain
- The **DNS server** used to retrieve the info

---

### ‚úÖ Look Up Mail Servers (MX Records)

```bash
nslookup -type=mx gmail.com
```

This lists the **mail exchange (MX) servers** responsible for receiving emails for `gmail.com`.

---

### ‚úÖ Query Name Servers (NS Records)

```bash
nslookup -type=ns ibm.com
```

This shows which **name servers** are responsible for managing the domain‚Äôs DNS records.

---

## üîé Step-by-Step: Using `dig`

`dig` (**Domain Information Groper**) is a more detailed and powerful tool than `nslookup`. It gives you full control over DNS queries.

### ‚úÖ View A Record for a Domain

```bash
dig google.com
```

Look for the **ANSWER SECTION**:

```
google.com.     299     IN      A       172.217.174.78
```

This shows the **IPv4 address** that `google.com` resolves to.

---

### ‚úÖ Look Up MX Records with `dig`

```bash
dig MX gmail.com
```

Scroll down to the **ANSWER SECTION** to see which servers handle email for Gmail.

---

### ‚úÖ Get All DNS Records for a Domain

```bash
dig ANY ibm.com
```

This fetches all available DNS records for `ibm.com`, including:

- A / AAAA
- CNAME
- MX
- NS
- TXT (used for SPF, DKIM, etc.)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Some domains may restrict "ANY" queries for security reasons.

---

# üõ†Ô∏è **Practice Exercises ‚Äì Networking in Linux**

These exercises will help reinforce your understanding of **network-related commands** in Linux. You'll be working with tools like `hostname`, `ping`, `ip`, `curl`, and `wget` to inspect network configuration, test connectivity, and transfer data.

---

## üîß Before You Begin

Make sure you're in the correct directory:

```bash
cd /home/project
pwd
```

You should see:

```
/home/project
```

Now let's go through each exercise step-by-step.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Display Your Host‚Äôs IP Address

### üí° Hint:

Use the `hostname` command with an option that shows the IP address.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
hostname -i
```

This displays your system‚Äôs internal **IPv4 address**, such as:

```
172.17.0.2
```

> This is useful for checking what IP address your machine is using on the local network.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Get Connectivity Stats on Your Connection to www.google.com

### üí° Hint:

Use the `ping` command with a limited number of packets.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
ping -c 5 www.google.com
```

This sends **5 ICMP echo requests** to Google's servers and returns stats like:

- Round-trip time (latency)
- Packet loss

Example output:

```
--- www.google.com ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 4005ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 10.2/11.8/13.9/1.2 ms
```

> This helps determine if your system can reach external sites and how fast it does so.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. View Info About Your Ethernet Adapter `eth0`

### üí° Hint:

Use the `ip` command to show details about the network interface.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
ip addr show eth0
```

This shows:

- Interface status (`UP`)
- IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
- MAC address
- Broadcast and subnet info

Look for the line starting with `inet` ‚Äî this is your **IP address**.

Example:

```
inet 172.17.0.2/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global eth0
```

> This is helpful when troubleshooting or configuring network interfaces.

---

## ‚úÖ 4. View the HTML Code for www.google.com‚Äôs Landing Page

### üí° Hint:

Use `curl` to fetch and display remote content.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
curl www.google.com
```

This displays the raw **HTML source code** of Google's homepage directly in your terminal.

> Tip: If the output looks messy, try saving it to a file instead (next step).

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Download the HTML Code for www.google.com‚Äôs Landing Page

### üí° Hint:

Use `wget` to download and save the page.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

```bash
wget www.google.com
```

This saves the downloaded HTML as:

```
index.html
```

Verify the file exists:

```bash
ls -l
```

You‚Äôll see something like:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 12345 Apr 5 10:00 index.html
```

> You now have a local copy of Google's home page!

# **File Archiving and Compression Commands in Linux**

---

## **1. Introduction**

‚úÖ Understand the difference between **archiving** and **compression**  
‚úÖ Create and extract **tarballs** (`.tar` files)  
‚úÖ Compress and decompress using **gzip** and **zip**  
‚úÖ Extract contents from **compressed archives**

These skills are essential for:

- Backing up data
- Transferring large collections of files
- Managing disk space

---

## **2. Key Concepts**

### **A. Archiving**

- **Definition**: Combines multiple files into a **single file** without reducing size.
- **Purpose**: For **portability and backup**.
- **Example Format**: `.tar`

### **B. Compression**

- **Definition**: Reduces file size by removing redundancy.
- **Purpose**: Saves **storage space**, speeds up **transfers**, and reduces **bandwidth usage**.
- **Common Tools**:
  - `gzip` ‚Äì used with `.tar.gz` or `.tgz`
  - `zip` ‚Äì used with `.zip`

---

## **3. Using `tar` ‚Äì Tape ARchiver**

### **Purpose**

Create or extract **archive files** (called **tarballs**) that bundle directories and files.

### **Basic Syntax**

```bash
tar [options] [archive_name.tar] [files_or_directories]
```

### **Common Options**

| Option | Meaning                                             |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `-c`   | Create a new archive                                |
| `-f`   | Specify filename                                    |
| `-t`   | List contents of an archive                         |
| `-x`   | Extract files from archive                          |
| `-z`   | Filter through gzip (for compression/decompression) |

---

### **A. Creating a Tar Archive**

To archive a directory called `notes`:

```bash
tar -cf notes.tar notes/
```

> Creates `notes.tar`, containing all files in the `notes` directory.

---

### **B. Listing Contents of a Tar File**

To view what's inside `notes.tar`:

```bash
tar -tf notes.tar
```

---

### **C. Extracting Files from a Tar Archive**

To extract files:

```bash
tar -xf notes.tar
```

---

### **D. Compressing a Tar Archive with GZIP**

To compress `notes.tar` into a smaller `notes.tar.gz`:

```bash
tar -czf notes.tar.gz notes/
```

> This bundles and compresses the `notes` directory into a single compressed archive.

---

### **E. Extracting a `.tar.gz` File**

To extract both the archive and its compressed contents:

```bash
tar -xzf notes.tar.gz
```

> The `-z` option automatically handles **gzip compression**.

---

## **4. Using `zip` and `unzip`**

### **A. What is `zip`?**

- Combines **compression and archiving** in one step.
- Produces `.zip` files ‚Äî widely supported across operating systems.

### **Creating a ZIP Archive**

To compress the `notes` folder into `notes.zip`:

```bash
zip -r notes.zip notes/
```

> The `-r` flag ensures **all subdirectories** are included.

---

### **Listing Contents of a ZIP File**

Use `unzip` to list contents:

```bash
unzip -l notes.zip
```

---

### **Extracting a ZIP File**

To extract the contents:

```bash
unzip notes.zip
```

> Automatically recreates the original directory structure.

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ physics/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ week1.txt
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ week2.txt
```

You can compress it into:

- `notes.tar` (just archived)
- `notes.tar.gz` (archived + compressed)
- `notes.zip` (compressed archive)

And later extract it back to the same structure using the appropriate command.

---

## **8. Final Tips**

- Use `tar` when preserving permissions and working in Linux/Unix environments.
- Use `zip` for cross-platform compatibility (e.g., sharing with Windows users).
- Always double-check your file extensions:
  - `.tar` ‚Üí just archived
  - `.tar.gz` or `.tgz` ‚Üí archived + compressed
  - `.zip` ‚Üí compressed archive
- Combine `tar` with `gzip` for efficient backups.
- Use `unzip` and `tar -tzf` to preview contents before extraction.

# üì¶ Exercise 1 - File and Folder Archiving and Compression

In this exercise, you learned how to **package**, **compress**, and **extract** files using the Linux command line tools:

- `tar` ‚Äì for creating `.tar` archives
- `zip` ‚Äì for compressing into `.zip` format
- `unzip` ‚Äì for extracting `.zip` files

These are essential skills for:

- Backing up data
- Transferring multiple files as a single package
- Saving disk space with compression
- Managing software distributions or logs

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ 1.1 Create and Manage File Archives with `tar`

#### Create a `.tar` archive of the `/bin` directory:

```bash
tar -cvf bin.tar /bin
```

- `-c` = create a new archive
- `-v` = show progress (verbose)
- `-f` = specify filename (`bin.tar`)

This creates a large file called `bin.tar`, which contains all files from the `/bin` directory.

---

#### List contents of the `.tar` archive:

```bash
tar -tvf bin.tar
```

This shows a detailed list of files inside the archive ‚Äî useful for verifying contents before extraction.

---

#### Extract files from the `.tar` archive:

```bash
tar -xvf bin.tar
```

- `-x` = extract
- `-v` = show progress
- `-f` = specify filename

After extraction, you'll see a folder named `bin` in your current directory.

> Tip: Use `ls -l` to confirm it was extracted correctly.

---

### üîπ 1.2 Package and Compress Archive Files with `zip`

#### Create a `.zip` file of all `.conf` files in `/etc`:

```bash
zip config.zip /etc/*.conf
```

This bundles all configuration files ending in `.conf` into one compressed file: `config.zip`.

---

#### Create a compressed ZIP archive of an entire directory:

```bash
zip -ry bin.zip /bin
```

- `-r` = recursively include all files and subdirectories
- `-y` = store symbolic links as such (instead of following them)

This compresses the entire `/bin` directory into a portable `bin.zip` file.

---

### üîπ 1.3 Extract, List, or Test ZIP Archives with `unzip`

#### List contents of a `.zip` file:

```bash
unzip -l config.zip
```

This shows what‚Äôs inside the archive without extracting anything ‚Äî helpful for previewing.

---

#### Extract all files from a `.zip` archive:

```bash
unzip -o bin.zip
```

- `-o` = overwrite existing files (useful if you run the command more than once)
- Automatically creates a `bin` directory containing the extracted files

---

| Extract zip archive  | `unzip -o archive.zip`            |

---

## üß† Why This Matters

Understanding archiving and compression helps you:

- Bundle and share multiple files easily
- Save storage space
- Backup important directories
- Transfer data securely between systems

`tar` is commonly used in Linux environments for packaging, while `zip` offers cross-platform compatibility with Windows and macOS.

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Combine `tar` and `gzip` for compressed archives:
  ```bash
  tar -czvf archive.tar.gz directory/
  ```
- Use wildcards with zip:
  ```bash
  zip logfiles.zip *.log
  ```
- Exclude files when zipping:
  ```bash
  zip -r project.zip project/ -x "*.git*"
  ```
