## üß© Understand What SSH Is

**SSH (Secure SHell)** is a protocol used to securely log into another computer over a network. It encrypts all communication between two systems.

So if you're connecting to your VM via SSH, you're basically logging into it remotely.

---

## üß™  Check If SSH Server Is Installed on Linux VM

Most Linux distributions do **not install the SSH server by default** for security reasons.

To check if `openssh-server` is installed:

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

If you get something like "active (running)", then SSH is already installed and running.

If not:

### üü¢ Install OpenSSH Server

For **Ubuntu/Debian-based** distros:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ssh
```


After installing, start the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

Enable it to start automatically on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

### Network Configuration (Host Machine and Router)

This is the most critical part for external access and depends heavily on your setup.

#### Option 1: Bridged Networking (Simplest for external access on the same LAN)

* **Concept:** The VM behaves like a separate physical machine on your local network. It gets its own IP address from your router's DHCP server, directly on the same subnet as your host machine and other devices.
* **Configuration in Virtualization Software:**
    * **VirtualBox:** In VM settings -> Network -> Adapter 1 -> Attached to: **Bridged Adapter**. Select the appropriate physical network adapter of your host.
    * **VMware Workstation/Fusion:** In VM settings -> Network Adapter -> Network connection: **Bridged (Automatic)** or select a specific physical adapter.
* **Usage:**
    1.  Ensure your VM gets an IP address on the same subnet as your host.
    2.  From any other device on the *same local network* (e.g., another PC, your phone connected to the same Wi-Fi), you can SSH directly to the VM's IP address:
        ```bash
        ssh username@VM_IP_ADDRESS
        ```
    * **Limitations:** This *still* doesn't allow direct access from *outside* your home/office network without further router configuration (Port Forwarding - see Option 3).

#### Option 2: NAT (Network Address Translation) with Port Forwarding (Most common for a VM behind a host)

* **Concept:** The VM gets an IP address on a *private, internal network* managed by the virtualization software. The host machine acts as a router for the VM, translating its private IP to the host's IP. To allow external devices to connect, you need to set up **Port Forwarding** on the host.
* **Configuration in Virtualization Software:**
    * **VirtualBox:** In VM settings -> Network -> Adapter 1 -> Attached to: **NAT**. Then click "Port Forwarding" button.
        * Add a new rule:
            * **Name:** `SSH` (or anything descriptive)
            * **Protocol:** `TCP`
            * **Host IP:** Leave blank (or your host's specific IP if you have multiple)
            * **Host Port:** `2222` (or any unused port you choose on your host, *not* 22, to avoid conflicts if your host has an SSH server).
            * **Guest IP:** `VM_IP_ADDRESS` (the IP you found in step I.3)
            * **Guest Port:** `22` (SSH default port on the VM)
    * **VMware Workstation/Fusion:** In VM settings -> Network Adapter -> Network connection: **NAT**. Then go to "Virtual Network Editor" (Edit menu) -> select the NAT network (usually VMnet8) -> click "NAT Settings..." -> "Add..."
        * **Host port:** `2222` (or chosen port)
        * **Virtual machine IP address:** `VM_IP_ADDRESS`
        * **Virtual machine port:** `22`
        * **Protocol:** `TCP`
* **Usage (from an external terminal, *on the same LAN as the host*):**
    You would SSH to your **host machine's IP address** (the one your host has on your LAN) on the **Host Port** you configured:
    ```bash
    ssh username@HOST_IP_ADDRESS -p 2222
    ```
    (Replace `2222` with your chosen Host Port).

#### Option 3: Port Forwarding on Your Main Router (For truly external access over the internet)

* **Concept:** If you want to access your VM from *outside your home or office network* (e.g., from a coffee shop, a friend's house), you need to configure **Port Forwarding** on your home/office router. This assumes your VM is reachable on your local network (either via Bridged Adapter or NAT with Host Port Forwarding).
* **Steps:**
    1.  **Identify your VM's IP on your LAN:**
        * If using **Bridged Adapter**, it's the `VM_IP_ADDRESS` directly.
        * If using **NAT with Host Port Forwarding**, it's your `HOST_IP_ADDRESS` (and the specific `Host Port` you set up in your virtualization software).
    2.  **Find your Router's Public IP Address:** Go to a website like `whatismyip.com` from your host machine. This is the IP address the outside world sees.
    3.  **Access your Router's Configuration:** Open a web browser and type your router's default gateway IP address (often `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`). Log in with your router's admin credentials.
    4.  **Navigate to Port Forwarding Settings:** Look for sections like "Port Forwarding," "NAT," "Virtual Servers," or "Firewall."
    5.  **Create a New Port Forwarding Rule:**
        * **Service Name:** `SSH_VM` (or descriptive name)
        * **External/Public Port:** `2222` (or any *high, unused port* you choose. **Avoid using 22 directly from the internet** as it's a common target for attacks. A port like `2222`, `30000`, `49152`, etc., is better.)
        * **Internal/Private IP Address:** This is the IP of the machine on your local network that receives the traffic.
            * If using **Bridged Adapter**: `VM_IP_ADDRESS`
            * If using **NAT (VirtualBox/VMware)**: `HOST_IP_ADDRESS`
        * **Internal/Private Port:** This is the port on the *internal machine* that the external port traffic should be forwarded to.
            * If using **Bridged Adapter**: `22` (the SSH port on your VM)
            * If using **NAT (VirtualBox/VMware)**: The `Host Port` you configured in your virtualization software (e.g., `2222`).
        * **Protocol:** `TCP`
        * **Enable/Save:** Apply the changes.
* **Usage (from any external terminal over the internet):**
    ```bash
    ssh username@YOUR_ROUTER_PUBLIC_IP -p 2222
    ```
    (Replace `2222` with the `External/Public Port` you set on your router).

    * **Consider Dynamic DNS (DDNS):** If your public IP changes frequently (most home internet connections do), your router's public IP will change. A DDNS service (like No-IP, DuckDNS, DynDNS) can map a hostname (e.g., `myvm.ddns.net`) to your dynamic public IP, so you can always use the hostname instead of the changing IP.

#### Option 4: Host-Only Networking (Only for Host-to-VM, not external)

* **Concept:** Creates a private network between the host and the VM(s) only. No access from other devices on the LAN or the internet. Useful for host-VM communication without exposing the VM.
* **Usage:** You would SSH from your host machine to the VM's IP on the host-only network.

#### Option 5: Cloud VMs (e.g., AWS EC2, Google Cloud, Azure)

* **Concept:** Cloud providers handle most networking, but you need to configure their firewall/security groups.
* **Steps:**
    1.  **Ensure SSH is installed and running** on the cloud VM (as in Section I).
    2.  **Configure Security Groups/Network Rules:** In your cloud provider's console, ensure that the security group (AWS, Azure) or firewall rules (Google Cloud) associated with your VM allow inbound TCP traffic on port 22 (or your custom SSH port) from your source IP address (or `0.0.0.0/0` for testing, though less secure).
    3.  **Use Public IP/DNS Name:** Cloud VMs usually have a public IP address or a public DNS name assigned.
* **Usage:**
    ```bash
    ssh username@VM_PUBLIC_IP_OR_DNS_NAME
    ```
    (Often uses SSH keys for authentication, which you'd configure in the cloud console and use with the `-i` flag: `ssh -i /path/to/your/key.pem username@VM_PUBLIC_IP`).


### Important Security Considerations:

* **Use SSH Keys:** Always prefer SSH key-based authentication over passwords, especially for external access. Generate a key pair (`ssh-keygen`), put the public key on your VM's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, and keep your private key secure on your local machine.
* **Disable Password Authentication for SSH:** Once keys are set up, disable password logins in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` (`PasswordAuthentication no`).
* **Change Default SSH Port (22):** As mentioned, using a non-standard port (e.g., 2222, 30000) for incoming external connections reduces automated scanning attempts.
* **Firewalls on All Levels:** Ensure firewalls are configured correctly on the VM, the host, and your router.
* **Fail2Ban:** Install `fail2ban` on your VM to automatically ban IPs that attempt brute-force SSH attacks.
* **Keep Software Updated:** Regularly update your VM's OS and SSH server.

##  **Configure VM Firewall (UFW/firewalld):**
Ensure the VM's internal firewall allows incoming SSH connections (default port 22).
* **Now, install the ufw package. (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt install ufw
```     
```bash
sudo ufw allow ssh  # This allows port 22/tcp OR sudo ufw allow 22/tcp 
sudo ufw enable         # If not already enabled
sudo ufw status verbose # helps to provide a richer and more detailed description of their operation.
```

## üìç Find the IP Address of the Linux VM

You need to know the **IP address** of your Linux VM so you can connect to it.

Run this command in the VM terminal:

```bash
ip a
# OR
ifconfig # if net-tools is installed
```

Look for something like:

```
inet 192.168.x.x
```

This is your local network IP address. Note it down.

Example output:
```
2: enp0s3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500...
    inet 192.168.1.100/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic enp0s3
```

In this case, the IP is: `192.168.1.100`

---
## üñ•Ô∏è  Connect to the VM Using SSH From Host Machine

Now open a terminal on your **host machine** (your main OS, not the VM), and type:

```bash
ssh username@vm-ip-address
```

Replace:
- `username` with your Linux VM username.
- `vm-ip-address` with the IP you noted earlier.

Example:

```bash
ssh alice@192.168.1.100 -p 22
```

Then press Enter and type the password when prompted.

If successful, you'll now be inside the Linux VM's terminal ‚Äî but connected via SSH!

---

# Set up SSH key-based authentication.

 This method is more secure than using passwords and allows you to log in without typing a password every time.

---

## üîê What Is SSH Key-Based Authentication?

SSH keys are a pair of cryptographic keys:
- **Private Key**: You keep this on your local machine (host), and it must be kept secret.
- **Public Key**: You copy this to the server (your Linux VM). It's safe to share.

When you connect via SSH, the system checks if your private key matches the public key on the server.

---

## üß∞ Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up SSH Keys

We‚Äôll do this from your **host machine** (your main computer) and then copy the public key to your **Linux VM**.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Generate an SSH Key Pair on Your Host Machine

Open a terminal on your **host machine** (not the VM).

Type:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

This command generates a strong RSA key pair with 4096 bits.

You'll see something like:

```
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/youruser/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

Just press **Enter** to accept the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).

Then it asks:

```
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
```

You can leave it empty or set a passphrase for extra security.

‚úÖ Done! Your keys are now created:
- Private key: `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
- Public key: `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Copy the Public Key to Your Linux VM

There are two common ways to do this:

#### üîπ Option A: Use `ssh-copy-id` (Recommended)

Run this on your host machine:

```bash
sudo ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@vm-ip-address
```

Replace:
- `username` with your Linux VM username.
- `vm-ip-address` with the IP of your VM (from earlier steps).


It will ask for your **password**, then copy the public key to the VM.

If successful, you‚Äôll see:

```
Number of key(s) added: 1
```

#### üîπ Option B: Manually Copy the Key (if `ssh-copy-id` not available)

On your **host machine**, view your public key:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy the entire line (it starts with `ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2...`).

Now, **log in to your Linux VM** normally via SSH:

```bash
ssh username@vm-ip-address
```

Once inside, create the `.ssh` directory and edit the `authorized_keys` file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Paste the public key into the file and save it (`Ctrl+O`, Enter, `Ctrl+X` in nano).

Set correct permissions:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Test SSH Without Password

Now try logging in again:

```bash
ssh username@vm-ip-address
```

If everything went well, you should be logged in **without being asked for a password**!

---

## üîí Optional: Disable Password Login (for extra security)

Once you've confirmed key-based login works, you can disable password-based SSH logins.

‚ö†Ô∏è Only do this if you‚Äôre sure your SSH key setup works.

Edit the SSH config file **on your Linux VM**:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Find these lines and change them to:

```
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
UsePAM no
```

Save and exit.

Then restart the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

Now only users with the correct private key can log in.

## üß† Summary of Important Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `~/.ssh/id_rsa` | Your private SSH key (never share this!) |
| `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` | Your public SSH key (can be shared safely) |
| `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` | File on the server that contains trusted public keys |
| `ssh-keygen` | Tool used to generate SSH key pairs |

---

## üí° Tips

- You can generate multiple SSH key pairs for different servers if needed.
- Always protect your private key ‚Äî especially if you set a passphrase.
- On Windows, you can use **WSL**, **Git Bash**, or **PuTTYgen** to generate SSH keys.
