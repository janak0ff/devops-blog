# **Practice Project: Automated Weather Data Collection using Shell Scripting and Cron**

## 🎯 **Objective**

Create an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process that:

- **Extracts** weather data daily at noon (local time) for kathmandu, Nepal.
- **Transforms** the raw data to extract actual and forecasted temperatures.
- **Loads** the cleaned data into a structured log file.
- **Schedules** the script to run automatically every day at noon.

---

## 🧩 **Project Breakdown**

### 1. **Data Source**

You will use `curl` to fetch data from [wttr.in](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in), a text-based weather service.

Example:

```bash
curl wttr.in/kathmandu
```

This returns current and forecasted weather information in human-readable format.

---

### 2. **Required Data**

Each day at **12:00 PM local time**, collect:

| Field     | Description                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `year`    | Year of the observation                          |
| `month`   | Month of the observation                         |
| `day`     | Day of the observation                           |
| `obs_tmp` | Observed temperature (°C) today                  |
| `fc_temp` | Forecasted temperature (°C) for tomorrow at noon |

---

### 3. **Desired Output Format**

A tab-separated file (`weather_report.tsv`) with header:

```
year	month	day	obs_tmp	fc_temp
2023	1	1	10	11
2023	1	2	11	12
...
```

---

## 🛠️ **Steps to Complete the Project**

### ✅ Step 1: Download Raw Weather Data

Use `curl` to get the data:

```bash
curl -s wttr.in/kathmandu
```

> `-s` suppresses progress output so only the result is shown.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Extract Relevant Temperature Data

The output includes multiple lines — you need to parse:

- The **current temperature** (e.g., `°C`)
- The **forecast for tomorrow at noon** (you may need to look for patterns like `Tomorrow:` or use line numbers)

Tips:

- Use `grep`, `awk`, or `sed` to extract lines containing temperatures.
- Use `date` command to get current date values.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Transform and Format the Data

Format the data into five columns:

- Year, month, day (from `date +"%Y %m %d"`)
- Observed temperature (today’s current temp)
- Forecasted temperature (tomorrow's noon temp)

---

### ✅ Step 4: Load Data into a Log File

Append the formatted data to a TSV file:

```bash
echo -e "$year\t$month\t$day\t$obs_tmp\t$fc_temp" >> weather_report.tsv
```

Ensure the header is added once at the beginning:

```bash
echo -e "year\tmonth\tday\tobs_tmp\tfc_temp" > weather_report.tsv
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: Automate Using Cron

Edit your crontab:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line to run the script daily at **12:00 PM**:

```cron
0 12 * * * /absolute/path/to/your_script.sh
```

Verify it works by checking your crontab:

```bash
crontab -l
```

---

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

- **Test each step separately** before combining them into a full script.
- Use `chmod +x your_script.sh` to make your script executable.
- Ensure the script logs errors or outputs to help with debugging (e.g., redirect output: `>> /path/to/logfile.log 2>&1`).
- Test cron by temporarily setting the schedule to run in a few minutes.
- Make sure your script handles missing or unexpected data gracefully.

# Practice Project: Historical Weather Forecast Comparison to Actuals

## Learning objectives

In this practice project, you will:

- Initialize your log file
- Write a Bash script to download, extract, and load raw data into a report
- Add some basic analytics to your report
- Schedule your report to update daily
- Measure and report on historical forecasting accuracy

We've broken this project down into manageable steps. Feel free to try any or all of these on your own; however, we recommend checking your work with the details provided.

---

# Exercise 1: Initialize Your Weather Report Log File

## 🎯 Objective

In this exercise, you will:

- Create a log file to store your weather data.
- Add a properly formatted header row that defines each column in the report.

This sets the foundation for collecting and organizing weather data in a structured way.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1.1 **Create the Log File**

You'll create a file named `rx_poc.log` which will store your daily weather observations and forecasts.

### 🔧 Task:

Create an empty file called `rx_poc.log`.

### 💻 Command:

```bash
touch rx_poc.log
```

> This creates a new, empty file named `rx_poc.log` in your current directory.

---

### 1.2 **Add a Header Row**

To make your log file readable and usable for analysis, you need to add a header row with meaningful column names.

### 📝 Columns:

| Column     | Description                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| `year`     | Year of observation           |
| `month`    | Month of observation          |
| `day`      | Day of observation            |
| `obs_temp` | Observed (actual) temperature |
| `fc_temp`  | Forecasted temperature        |

### 🔧 Task:

Write the header to `rx_poc.log`, using **tab-separated** values.

### 💻 Command:

```bash
echo -e "year\tmonth\tday\tobs_temp\tfc_temp" > rx_poc.log
```

> - `echo -e` enables interpretation of backslash escapes like `\t` (tab).
> - `>` overwrites the file — perfect for writing the first line (header).

---

## 💡 Why Use Variables?

As mentioned in the hint, using variables can make your code cleaner and more maintainable.

### Example with variable:

```bash
header=$(echo -e "year\tmonth\tday\tobs_temp\tfc_temp")
echo "$header" > rx_poc.log
```

This is especially useful when you want to reuse or modify the header later.

---

## ✅ Final Output

After completing this exercise, your `rx_poc.log` file should contain only one line:

```
year	month	day	obs_temp	fc_temp
```

(Columns separated by tabs)

---

## 🧪 Verify Your Work

To check the contents of the file:

```bash
cat rx_poc.log
```

You should see the header printed clearly.

---

## ✅ Summary

| Task                     | Command                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Create empty log file    | `touch rx_poc.log`                        |
| Add tab-separated header | `echo -e "year\tmonth\t..." > rx_poc.log` |

---

# Exercise 2: Download the Raw Weather Data

## 🎯 Objective

In this exercise, you will:

- Create a Bash script to automate weather data retrieval.
- Assign the city name (`kathmandu`) to a variable for flexibility.
- Use `curl` to download raw weather data and save it to a file named `weather_report`.

This sets up the **"Extract"** phase of your ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 2.1 **Create an Executable Bash Script**

You'll create a new shell script called `rx_poc.sh` that can be run directly from the terminal.

### 🔧 Task:

Create the script and make it executable.

### 💻 Commands:

#### Create the file:

```bash
touch rx_poc.sh
```

#### Add the shebang line (first line in the file):

```bash
echo '#!/bin/bash' > rx_poc.sh
```

> The shebang (`#! /bin/bash`) tells the system that this is a Bash script.

#### Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod u+x rx_poc.sh
```

> This gives **u**ser **+x** execute permissions on the script.

#### Verify:

```bash
ls -l rx_poc.sh
```

You should see something like:

```
-rwxr--r-- 1 user group ... rx_poc.sh
```

---

### 2.2 **Assign the City Name to a Variable**

To make your script flexible and easier to modify, store the city name in a variable.

### 🔧 Task:

Set a variable `city` to `kathmandu`.

### 💻 Command:

Add this line inside your script:

```bash
city=kathmandu
```

> Using variables like `city` makes it easy to change locations later without hardcoding values.

---

### 2.3 **Download Weather Data Using curl**

Use the `curl` command to fetch weather data for kathmandu from [wttr.in](https://wttr.in), a text-based weather service.

### 🔧 Task:

Download the weather report and save it to a file named `weather_report`.

### 💻 Command:

Add this to your script:

```bash
curl -s wttr.in/$city?T --output weather_report
```

> - `-s`: Silent mode — suppresses progress output.
> - `$city`: Uses the variable you defined earlier.
> - `?T`: Disables color codes for cleaner text output.
> - `--output weather_report`: Saves the result into a file called `weather_report`.

---

## 📝 Final Script (`rx_poc.sh`)

Your script should now look like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

city=kathmandu
curl -s wttr.in/$city?T --output weather_report
```

---

## 🧪 Test Your Script

Run your script to verify it downloads the weather data:

```bash
./rx_poc.sh
```

Check the contents of the downloaded file:

```bash
cat weather_report
```

You should see a human-readable weather report for kathmandu.

---

## ✅ Summary

| Task                  | Command / Line                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Create script file    | `touch rx_poc.sh`                                 |

| Make executable       | `chmod u+x rx_poc.sh`                             |
| Assign city variable  | `city=kathmandu`                                  |
| Download weather data | `curl -s wttr.in/$city?T --output weather_report` |

---

Great job! You've successfully created a Bash script that downloads weather data for kathmandu and saves it to a file. In the next exercise, you’ll extract the actual and forecasted temperatures from this raw data.

---

# Exercise 3: Extract and Load the Required Data

## 🎯 Objective

In this exercise, you will:

- **Extract** the current observed temperature and tomorrow's noon forecasted temperature from raw weather data.
- Store them in shell variables: `obs_temp` and `fc_temp`.
- Get the current **local date** (year, month, day) for kathmandu using the correct time zone.
- **Format and append** the extracted data as a new row to your log file `rx_poc.log`.

This completes the **"Transform"** and **"Load"** phases of your ETL process.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 3.1 **Extract Temperature Data**

You'll extract two key values:

- `obs_temp`: The **current observed temperature**
- `fc_temp`: The **forecasted temperature for tomorrow at noon**

#### 🔧 Task:

Update your script to extract these values using text processing tools like `grep`, `cut`, and `head/tail`.

### 💻 Code to Add in `rx_poc.sh`:

```bash
# --- EXTRACT TEMPERATURE DATA ---

# Observed temperature
obs_temp=$(curl -s wttr.in/$city?T | grep -m 1 '°.' | grep -Eo -e '-?[[:digit:]].*')
echo "The current Temperature of $city: $obs_temp"

# Forecast temperature for noon tomorrow
fc_temp=$(curl -s wttr.in/$city?T | head -23 | tail -1 | grep '°.' | cut -d 'C' -f2 | grep -Eo -e '-?[[:digit:]].*')
echo "The forecasted temperature for noon tomorrow for $city: $fc_temp"
```

> - `grep -m 1`: gets only the first match (current temp)
> - `grep -Eo`: extracts only the numeric part of the temperature
> - `head/tail`: helps isolate the specific line with tomorrow’s noon forecast

---

### 3.2 **Get Current Local Date for kathmandu**

Since the analytics team wants data in **local time**, you must set the correct time zone.

### 🔧 Task:

Use the `date` command with the `TZ` environment variable to get local date components.

### 💻 Code to Add:

```bash
# Set time zone for kathmandu
TZ='Asia/kathmandu'

# Get year, month, day in local time
day=$(date +%d)
month=$(date +%m)
year=$(date +%Y)
```

> This ensures accurate date values based on **kathmandu's local time** (UTC+5:45).

---

### 3.3 **Format and Append Data to Log File**

Now combine all five fields into one tab-separated record and append it to your log file.

### 🔧 Task:

Construct a record string and add it to `rx_poc.log`.

### 💻 Code to Add:

```bash
# Format record with tabs
record=$(echo -e "$year\t$month\t$day\t$obs_temp\t$fc_temp")

# Append to log file
echo -e "$record" >> rx_poc.log
```

> - `>>` appends without overwriting existing content
> - `-e` enables interpretation of `\t` as tab characters

---

## 📝 Final Script (`rx_poc.sh`) Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# --- CONFIG ---
city=kathmandu

# --- DOWNLOAD RAW DATA ---
curl -s wttr.in/$city?T --output weather_report

# --- EXTRACT TEMPERATURES ---
obs_temp=$(curl -s wttr.in/$city?T | grep -m 1 '°.' | grep -Eo -e '-?[[:digit:]].*')
fc_temp=$(curl -s wttr.in/$city?T | head -23 | tail -1 | grep '°.' | cut -d 'C' -f2 | grep -Eo -e '-?[[:digit:]].*')

# --- GET LOCAL DATE ---
TZ='Asia/kathmandu'
day=$(date +%d)
month=$(date +%m)
year=$(date +%Y)

# --- FORMAT AND APPEND TO LOG ---
record=$(echo -e "$year\t$month\t$day\t$obs_temp\t$fc_temp")
echo -e "$record" >> rx_poc.log
```

---

## 🧪 Test Your Script

Run the script manually:

```bash
./rx_poc.sh
```

Check the log file:

```bash
cat rx_poc.log
```

You should see the header followed by a new row like:

```
year	month	day	obs_temp	fc_temp
2025	4	5	22	24
```

---

## ✅ Summary

| Task                           | Key Tools Used                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Download weather data          | `curl`                                |
| Extract observed temperature   | `grep`, `grep -Eo`                    |
| Extract forecasted temperature | `head`, `tail`, `grep`, `cut`, `grep` |
| Get local date                 | `date`, `TZ='Asia/kathmandu'`         |
| Format and append record       | `echo -e`, `>>`                       |

---

Great job! You've successfully built a full ETL pipeline that:

- Downloads weather data
- Parses and cleans relevant values
- Logs structured data daily

---

# Exercise 4: Schedule Your Bash Script to Run Daily at Noon (kathmandu Time)

## 🎯 Objective

In this exercise, you will:

- Determine the correct **system time** equivalent for **12:00 PM kathmandu time**.
- Use `crontab` to schedule your script (`rx_poc.sh`) to run automatically every day at that time.

This completes the automation of your ETL pipeline.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 4.1 **Determine Correct Cron Time**

Since cron uses your system's local time, you need to convert **noon in kathmandu (UTC+5:45)** to your system’s local time.

### 🔧 Task:

Check your system time and UTC time:

```bash
date
date -u
```

#### Example Output:

```
Mon Feb 13 11:28:12 EST 2023   # System time (EST = UTC-5)
Mon Feb 13 16:28:16 UTC 2023   # UTC time
```

Now calculate:

- kathmandu is **UTC+5:45**
- Your system is **UTC-5**
- So, difference between your system and kathmandu = **6 hours**

👉 Therefore, **12:00 PM in kathmandu = 6:00 AM on your system**

---

### 4.2 **Edit Crontab to Add Your Job**

You’ll now edit your crontab file to add a job that runs daily at the calculated time.

### 💻 Command:

```bash
crontab -e
```

> This opens the default text editor.

### 🔧 Task:

Add the following line to schedule the script daily at **8:00 AM system time** (replace with your actual converted time):

```cron
0 8 * * * /absolute/path/to/rx_poc.sh
```

Example:

```cron
0 8 * * * /home/user/weather_project/rx_poc.sh
```

> - `0 8`: Means "at 8:00 AM"
> - `* * *`: Every day of the week, every month, every weekday

Save and exit the editor.

---

### 🧪 Verify Your Cron Job

To confirm it was added correctly:

```bash
crontab -l
```

You should see your new cron entry listed.

---

## 📝 Final Notes

- Ensure your script path is **absolute**, not relative.
- Make sure your script is **executable** (`chmod u+x rx_poc.sh`)
- You can test your cron setup by temporarily scheduling the job to run in a few minutes:
  ```cron
  */2 * * * * /path/to/rx_poc.sh
  ```
  (Runs every 2 minutes — useful for testing)

---

## ✅ Summary

| Task                                 | Command / Action                        |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Check system time                    | `date`                                  |
| Check UTC time                       | `date -u`                               |
| Convert noon kathmandu → system time | Manual calculation (UTC+5:45 vs system) |
| Edit crontab                         | `crontab -e`                            |
| Add daily cron job                   | `0 8 * * * /path/to/rx_poc.sh`          |
| List current cron jobs               | `crontab -l`                            |

---

🎉 **Congratulations!**  
You've successfully automated your weather data collection process. Every day at noon (local time in kathmandu), your script will:

- Download weather data
- Extract observed and forecasted temperatures
- Log them in a structured format
- All without manual intervention!

---

# Exercise 5: Create a Script to Report Historical Forecast Accuracy

## 🎯 Objective

In this exercise, you will:

- Create a new script `fc_accuracy.sh` that:
  - Calculates how accurate past temperature forecasts were compared to actual observed temperatures.
  - Labels the accuracy based on defined ranges (e.g., excellent, good, fair, poor).
  - Appends the result to a historical accuracy report file.

This gives you the ability to **analyze and evaluate forecasting performance** over time.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 5.0 **Initialize the Historical Accuracy File**

Before calculating accuracy, create a new tab-separated file with headers:

```bash
echo -e "year\tmonth\tday\tobs_temp\tfc_temp\taccuracy\taccuracy_range" > historical_fc_accuracy.tsv
```

> This file will store each day’s forecast vs. actual comparison.

---

## 🧩 Section 5.1: Calculate Forecast Accuracy for One Day

We'll start by analyzing just one day — today's observed temp vs yesterday's forecast.

### 5.1.1 **Extract Yesterday’s Forecasted Temperature**

Assume the second-to-last line in `rx_poc.log` contains yesterday’s forecast.

```bash
yesterday_fc=$(tail -2 rx_poc.log | head -1 | cut -d $'\t' -f5)
```

> This extracts the **forecasted temperature** from yesterday’s log entry.

---

### 5.1.2 **Extract Today’s Observed Temperature**

The last line of the log is today’s data:

```bash
today_temp=$(tail -1 rx_poc.log | cut -d $'\t' -f4)
```

> This gets today’s **observed temperature**.

---

### 5.1.3 **Calculate Forecast Accuracy**

Compute the difference between forecast and observation:

```bash
accuracy=$((yesterday_fc - today_temp))
```

> Positive values = forecast was too high  
> Negative values = forecast was too low

---

## 🧩 Section 5.2: Assign an Accuracy Label

Use conditional logic to label the forecast accuracy:

```bash
if [ -1 -le $accuracy ] && [ $accuracy -le 1 ]; then
    accuracy_range="excellent"
elif [ -2 -le $accuracy ] && [ $accuracy -le 2 ]; then
    accuracy_range="good"
elif [ -3 -le $accuracy ] && [ $accuracy -le 3 ]; then
    accuracy_range="fair"
else
    accuracy_range="poor"
fi
```

> This categorizes forecast accuracy into four levels.

---

## 🧩 Section 5.3: Append Record to Accuracy Log

Now extract the date and build a full record:

```bash
row=$(tail -1 rx_poc.log)
year=$(echo "$row" | cut -d $'\t' -f1)
month=$(echo "$row" | cut -d $'\t' -f2)
day=$(echo "$row" | cut -d $'\t' -f3)
```

Then append all fields to your accuracy file:

```bash
echo -e "$year\t$month\t$day\t$today_temp\t$yesterday_fc\t$accuracy\t$accuracy_range" >> historical_fc_accuracy.tsv
```

---

## 📄 Final Script (`fc_accuracy.sh`)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# --- EXTRACT FORECAST & OBSERVED TEMP ---
yesterday_fc=$(tail -2 rx_poc.log | head -1 | cut -d $'\t' -f5)
today_temp=$(tail -1 rx_poc.log | cut -d $'\t' -f4)

# --- CALCULATE ACCURACY ---
accuracy=$((yesterday_fc - today_temp))

# --- ASSIGN ACCURACY LABEL ---
if [ -1 -le $accuracy ] && [ $accuracy -le 1 ]; then
    accuracy_range="excellent"
elif [ -2 -le $accuracy ] && [ $accuracy -le 2 ]; then
    accuracy_range="good"
elif [ -3 -le $accuracy ] && [ $accuracy -le 3 ]; then
    accuracy_range="fair"
else
    accuracy_range="poor"
fi

# --- APPEND TO HISTORICAL REPORT ---
row=$(tail -1 rx_poc.log)
year=$(echo "$row" | cut -d $'\t' -f1)
month=$(echo "$row" | cut -d $'\t' -f2)
day=$(echo "$row" | cut -d $'\t' -f3)

echo -e "$year\t$month\t$day\t$today_temp\t$yesterday_fc\t$accuracy\t$accuracy_range" >> historical_fc_accuracy.tsv
```

---

## 🧪 Test Your Script

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x fc_accuracy.sh
```

Run it manually:

```bash
./fc_accuracy.sh
```

Check the output:

```bash
cat historical_fc_accuracy.tsv
```

You should see something like:

```
year	month	day	obs_temp	fc_temp	accuracy	accuracy_range
2025	4	5	22	24	-2	good
```

---

## 🔄 Optional: Generalize for All Days

To process the entire log at once, loop through pairs of lines:

```bash
tail -n +2 rx_poc.log | while read line; do
    # Save previous line as forecast
    if [ -n "$prev_line" ]; then
        yesterday_fc=$(echo "$prev_line" | cut -d $'\t' -f5)
        today_temp=$(echo "$line" | cut -d $'\t' -f4)
        accuracy=$((yesterday_fc - today_temp))

        # ... rest of processing ...
    fi
    prev_line="$line"
done
```

This allows you to build a full history of forecast accuracy across multiple days.

# Exercise 6: Create a Script to Report Weekly Statistics of Historical Forecasting Accuracy

## 🎯 Objective

In this exercise, you will:

- Download a **synthetic historical forecasting accuracy dataset**.
- Write a Bash script called `weekly_stats.sh` that:
  - Extracts the last 7 days of forecast errors.
  - Calculates and displays the **minimum** and **maximum absolute errors** for the week.

This helps you understand how to analyze performance trends over time using shell scripting.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 6.1 **Download the Synthetic Dataset**

You'll begin by downloading a synthetic TSV file containing historical forecast accuracy data.

### 💻 Command:

```bash
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-LX0117EN-Coursera/labs/synthetic_historical_fc_accuracy.tsv
```

> This creates a file named `synthetic_historical_fc_accuracy.tsv` in your current directory.

---

### 6.2 **Create the Script `weekly_stats.sh`**

Now create a new executable Bash script to process the weekly forecast errors.

### 💻 Commands:

```bash
touch weekly_stats.sh
chmod +x weekly_stats.sh
```

Then open it with your favorite editor (like `nano`, `vim`, or `gedit`) and start editing.

---

### 6.3 **Extract Last Week's Forecast Errors**

We extract the last 7 lines from the dataset and keep only the "accuracy" column (column 6).

```bash
echo $(tail -7 synthetic_historical_fc_accuracy.tsv | cut -f6) > scratch.txt
week_fc=($(cat scratch.txt))
```

> This stores the last 7 forecast errors into a Bash array called `week_fc`.

---

### 6.4 **Validate the Array Contents (Optional)**

Print each value to verify the contents:

```bash
for i in {0..6}; do
    echo ${week_fc[$i]}
done
```

---

### 6.5 **Convert to Absolute Values**

Loop through the array and convert negative values to positive:

```bash
for i in {0..6}; do
  if [[ ${week_fc[$i]} < 0 ]]; then
    week_fc[$i]=$(( -1 * ${week_fc[$i]} ))
  fi
done
```

> This ensures all values represent **absolute error**.

---

### 6.6 **Calculate Minimum and Maximum Error**

Initialize min/max variables and loop through the array:

```bash
minimum=${week_fc[0]}
maximum=${week_fc[0]}

for item in "${week_fc[@]}"; do
  if (( $item < $minimum )); then
    minimum=$item
  fi
  if (( $item > $maximum )); then
    maximum=$item
  fi
done
```

---

### 6.7 **Display Results**

Finally, print the results:

```bash
echo "Minimum absolute error = $minimum"
echo "Maximum absolute error = $maximum"
```

---

## 📄 Final Script (`weekly_stats.sh`)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Extract the last 7 accuracy values
tail -7 synthetic_historical_fc_accuracy.tsv | cut -f6 > scratch.txt
week_fc=($(cat scratch.txt))

# Convert to absolute values
for i in {0..6}; do
  if [[ ${week_fc[$i]} -lt 0 ]]; then
    week_fc[$i]=$(( -1 * ${week_fc[$i]} ))
  fi
done

# Initialize min and max
minimum=${week_fc[0]}
maximum=${week_fc[0]}

# Find min and max
for item in "${week_fc[@]}"; do
  if (( item < minimum )); then
    minimum=$item
  fi
  if (( item > maximum )); then
    maximum=$item
  fi
done

# Output result
echo "Minimum absolute error = $minimum"
echo "Maximum absolute error = $maximum"
```

---

## 🧪 Test Your Script

Make sure the dataset is downloaded:

```bash
ls -l synthetic_historical_fc_accuracy.tsv
```

Run your script:

```bash
./weekly_stats.sh
```

Expected output:

```
Minimum absolute error = 0
Maximum absolute error = 4
```

(Values may vary depending on dataset content.)

# 🔧 **Final Project Tasks : Script Development Guide**

In this guide, we'll walk through each of the first six tasks in your `backup.sh` script.

You’ll be writing Bash code to:

- Accept command-line arguments
- Set variables for readability and use
- Capture timestamps
- Define file names and paths

---

## ✅ **Task 1: Set Variables from Command-Line Arguments**

### 🎯 Objective:

Capture two directories using command line arguments:

- The directory to back up (`targetDirectory`)
- The destination directory for the backup (`destinationDirectory`)

### 📄 Code:

```bash
# [TASK 1]
targetDirectory=$1
destinationDirectory=$2
```

> `$1` is the first argument, `$2` is the second one provided when running the script.

📁 Example usage:

```bash
./backup.sh /etc/secrets /backup
```

---

## ✅ **Task 2: Display the Values of the Arguments**

### 🎯 Objective:

Print both directory paths to the terminal so users can confirm what was passed.

### 📄 Code:

```bash
# [TASK 2]
echo "Target Directory: $targetDirectory"
echo "Destination Directory: $destinationDirectory"
```

---

## ✅ **Task 3: Define a Timestamp Variable**

### 🎯 Objective:

Create a variable called `currentTS` that holds the current timestamp in seconds since epoch.

This will help create unique filenames for backups.

### 📄 Code:

```bash
# [TASK 3]
currentTS=$(date +%s)
```

> `$(date +%s)` runs the `date` command and captures its output (seconds since Jan 1, 1970).

---

## ✅ **Task 4: Set Backup File Name Using Timestamp**

### 🎯 Objective:

Build a filename like `backup-1634571345.tar.gz` using the timestamp.

### 📄 Code:

```bash
# [TASK 4]
backupFileName="backup-$currentTS.tar.gz"
```

> This creates a unique archive name for each run.

---

## ✅ **Task 5: Get Absolute Path of Current Directory**

### 🎯 Objective:

Store the absolute path of the current working directory in a variable called `origAbsPath`.

### 📄 Code:

```bash
# [TASK 5]
origAbsPath=$(pwd)
```

> `$(pwd)` returns the full path of the current directory.

---

## ✅ **Task 6: Get Absolute Path of Destination Directory**

### 🎯 Objective:

Change to the destination directory and capture its absolute path in `destAbsPath`.

Also include error handling if the directory doesn't exist or is inaccessible.

### 📄 Code:

```bash
# [TASK 6]
cd "$destinationDirectory" || exit
destAbsPath=$(pwd)
```

> - `cd "$destinationDirectory"` attempts to move to the target dir.
> - `|| exit` ensures the script exits cleanly if the `cd` fails.
> - `$(pwd)` gets the full path after changing directories.

---

## 📌 Summary Table

| Task | Objective                   | Code                                            |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --- | ------------------------- |
| 1    | Set variables from args     | `targetDirectory=$1`, `destinationDirectory=$2` |
| 2    | Echo values to screen       | `echo "$targetDirectory"`, etc.                 |
| 3    | Store current timestamp     | `currentTS=$(date +%s)`                         |
| 4    | Build backup filename       | `backupFileName="backup-$currentTS.tar.gz"`     |
| 5    | Save current directory path | `origAbsPath=$(pwd)`                            |
| 6    | Save destination dir path   | `cd "$destinationDirectory"                     |     | exit; destAbsPath=$(pwd)` |

---

## ✅ **Task 7: Change to Target Directory**

### 🎯 Objective:

Navigate from the current working directory to the `targetDirectory`.

We’ll first return to the original absolute path (`origAbsPath`) and then move into the target directory.

This ensures we're in the correct location when searching for files.

### 📄 Code:

```bash
# [TASK 7]
cd "$origAbsPath" || exit
cd "$targetDirectory" || exit
```

> - `cd "$origAbsPath"` returns to the starting directory
> - `cd "$targetDirectory"` moves into the folder containing encrypted files
> - `|| exit` ensures the script stops if it can't access a directory

---

## ✅ **Task 8: Define Timestamp for 24 Hours Ago**

### 🎯 Objective:

Calculate a variable called `yesterdayTS` that holds the timestamp (in seconds) of **24 hours before `currentTS`**.

This value will be used later to find files modified in the last 24 hours.

### 📄 Code:

```bash
# [TASK 8]
yesterdayTS=$(($currentTS - 24 * 60 * 60))
```

> - `$(($currentTS - 24*60*60))` subtracts 24 hours (in seconds) from the current timestamp
> - This gives us a Unix timestamp representing 24 hours ago

---

# 🧠 **Understanding Arrays in Bash – A Practical Guide**

In your final project script, you'll encounter this line:

```bash
declare -a toBackup
```

This line declares a variable called `toBackup` as an **array** — a special type of variable that can hold **multiple values**, which is extremely useful when dealing with lists of files or other data.

---

## 🔧 What is an Array?

An **array** is like a list: it allows you to store and manage multiple items under a single variable name.

### ✅ Example:

```bash
declare -a myArray
myArray+=("Linux")
myArray+=("is")
myArray+=("cool!")
```

Now, `myArray` contains:

- `"Linux"` at index 0
- `"is"` at index 1
- `"cool!"` at index 2

You can print the entire array using:

```bash
echo ${myArray[@]}
```

### 💻 Output:

```
Linux is cool!
```

> `${myArray[@]}` expands to all elements in the array, separated by spaces.

---

## ➕ How to Add Items to an Array

Use the `+=()` syntax to append items:

```bash
myArray+=("new item")
```

In your script, this line will be used to collect all files modified in the last 24 hours:

```bash
toBackup+=($file)
```

This adds each matching file to the `toBackup` array.

---

## 📁 Using Arrays with `tar` for Backup

Once you've collected all the files you want to back up into the `toBackup` array, you can pass them all at once to the `tar` command:

```bash
tar -czvf "$backupFileName" "${toBackup[@]}"
```

This creates a `.tar.gz` archive containing all the files listed in the `toBackup` array.

> The quotes around `"${toBackup[@]}"` are important — they preserve spaces in filenames.

---

## 🧪 Full Example in Context

Here's how arrays are used in your backup script:

```bash
# Declare an empty array
declare -a toBackup

# Loop through all files in current directory
for file in *
do
    # Get last modified time of file (in seconds)
    fileTS=$(date -r "$file" +%s)

    # If file was modified within the last 24 hours
    if [[ $fileTS -gt $yesterdayTS ]]
    then
        # Add it to the backup list
        toBackup+=("$file")
    fi
done

# Archive all files in the array
tar -czvf "$backupFileName" "${toBackup[@]}"
```

---

## ✅ **Task 9: Loop Through All Files and Directories**

### 🎯 Objective:

Use a `for` loop with the wildcard `*` to iterate over all items in the current directory.

This is useful for checking each file or folder to determine whether it should be backed up.

### 📄 Code:

```bash
# [TASK 9]
for file in *
do
```

> The `*` wildcard matches every file and directory in the current working directory.

---

## ✅ **Task 10: Check If File Was Modified Within Last 24 Hours**

### 🎯 Objective:

Inside the loop, check if the file was modified within the last 24 hours by comparing its modification time (`date -r $file +%s`) to the `yesterdayTS` timestamp.

### 📄 Code:

```bash
# [TASK 10]
    if [[ `date -r "$file" +%s` -gt $yesterdayTS ]]
    then
```

> - `date -r "$file" +%s`: gets the last modified time of the file in seconds
> - `-gt`: means "greater than"
> - `$yesterdayTS`: is the timestamp from 24 hours ago

---

## ✅ **Task 11: Add Matching Files to Backup Array**

### 🎯 Objective:

If the file was modified in the last 24 hours, add it to the `toBackup` array.

This array will later be used to create the backup archive.

### 📄 Code:

```bash
# [TASK 11]
        toBackup+=("$file")
    fi
done
```

> - `toBackup+=("$file")` adds the file to the array
> - `fi` closes the `if` statement
> - `done` ends the `for` loop

---

## 🧪 Full Code Block (Tasks 9–11)

Here’s how these sections fit together:

```bash
# [TASK 9]
for file in *
do
    # [TASK 10]
    if [[ `date -r "$file" +%s` -gt $yesterdayTS ]]
    then
        # [TASK 11]
        toBackup+=("$file")
    fi
done
```

> This block:
>
> - Loops through all files/dirs
> - Checks their modification time
> - Adds recent ones to the backup list

---

## ✅ **Task 12: Compress Files into an Archive**

### 🎯 Objective:

Use the `tar` command to compress all files collected in the `toBackup` array into a single `.tar.gz` file named using the timestamped filename stored in `backupFileName`.

### 📄 Code:

```bash
# [TASK 12]
tar -czvf "$backupFileName" "${toBackup[@]}"
```

> - `c`: create a new archive
> - `z`: compress with gzip
> - `v`: verbose output (show progress)
> - `f`: specify filename
> - `"${toBackup[@]}"`: expands to all files added to the array

---

## ✅ **Task 13: Move Backup File to Destination Directory**

### 🎯 Objective:

Move the newly created backup archive from the current directory to the destination directory (`destAbsPath`), where backups are stored permanently.

### 📄 Code:

```bash
# [TASK 13]
mv "$backupFileName" "$destAbsPath/"
```

> - `mv`: moves the file
> - `"$destAbsPath/"`: ensures it goes to the correct destination directory

---

## 🧪 Full Code Block (Tasks 12–13)

Here’s how these two sections fit together:

```bash
# [TASK 12]
tar -czvf "$backupFileName" "${toBackup[@]}"

# [TASK 13]
mv "$backupFileName" "$destAbsPath/"
```

> This block:
>
> - Archives all recent files into one compressed `.tar.gz` file
> - Moves that file to the designated backup storage location

---

## ✅ **Task 14: Save and Download backup.sh**

### 🎯 Objective:

Save your completed `backup.sh` file locally for submission.

### 🔧 Steps:

1. **Save the file:**

   - Press:
     - **Windows/Linux:** `CTRL + S`
     - **Mac:** `CMD + S`

2. **Download the file:**
   - Go to:
     ```
     File → Download
     ```

✅ You now have a local copy of your script ready to submit for peer grading.

---

## ✅ **Task 15: Make Script Executable**

### 🎯 Objective:

Ensure your script can be run directly from the terminal.

### 📄 Code:

```bash
chmod +x backup.sh
ls -l backup.sh
```

> - `chmod +x`: makes the file executable
> - `ls -l`: shows permissions — you should see `-rwxr-xr-x` or similar

---

## ✅ **Task 16: Test Your Script Manually**

### 🎯 Objective:

Test that your script correctly creates a backup archive.

### 📄 Commands:

```bash
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-LX0117EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Final%20Project/important-documents.zip
unzip -DDo important-documents.zip
touch important-documents/*
./backup.sh important-documents .
```

> This:
>
> - Downloads a sample folder (`important-documents`)
> - Updates all files' timestamps
> - Runs your script to back up modified files

### ✅ Check Output:

```bash
ls -l
```

You should see a file like:

```
backup-1634571345.tar.gz
```

---

## ✅ **Task 17: Schedule Script with Cron**

### 🎯 Objective:

Schedule your script to run daily using `cron`.

### 📄 Steps:

#### Step 1: Copy script to system-wide bin

```bash
sudo cp backup.sh /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Step 2: Start cron service

```bash
sudo service cron start
```

#### Step 3: Open crontab editor

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line to schedule the script to run **every minute** (for testing):

```cron
*/1 * * * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh /home/project/important-documents /home/project
```

Wait a minute and check if new `.tar.gz` files appear in `/home/project`.

Once verified, stop cron:

```bash
sudo service cron stop
```

Now edit your crontab again and change the schedule to run once **daily at midnight**:

```cron
0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh /home/project/important-documents /home/project
```

Save and exit.

To verify your cron job:

```bash
crontab -l
```

---


## 📌 Final Notes

- Always test scripts manually before scheduling them.
- Use `chmod +x` so scripts can be executed directly.
- Cron requires the full path to your script and directories.
- In virtual environments like Theia, you must explicitly start `cron`.

---
