### For Your Linux Virtual Machine (VM) running in VMware Workstation:

This is where the magic happens for consistent access. If you want your VM to always have the same IP address **from the perspective of your host machine**, or if you want it to be accessible consistently on the *current local network* you're on, you should primarily use **NAT networking** in VMware Workstation.



**A. VMware Network Adapter Setting for the VM: Use NAT (Network Address Translation)**

* **How it works:** VMware Workstation creates a private virtual network (e.g., `VMnet8` by default) between your host machine and your VM. Your host acts as a router for the VM. The VM gets an IP address on this private virtual network, which **does not change** even if your host laptop's public IP changes.
* **Benefits:**
    * The VM always gets Internet access through your host, regardless of which physical network your host is on.
    * The VM's IP address (within the NAT network) remains static and consistent from the host's perspective.
   
**B. Static IP Configuration *Inside the VM* (using `nmtui`)**

* **Choose an IP within VMware's NAT subnet:**
    * Go to **Edit > Virtual Network Editor...** in VMware Workstation.
    * Select `VMnet8` (NAT).
    * Note down the **Subnet IP** (e.g., `192.168.100.0`) and the **Gateway IP** (e.g., `192.168.100.2`).
    * Choose a static IP for your VM **within this range** that is *outside* the DHCP range usually managed by VMware (e.g., if DHCP gives out from .128 to .254, pick something like `192.168.100.10`).
* **Use `nmtui` in your VM** to set this static IP as previously instructed.
    * **IP Address:** Your chosen static IP (e.g., `192.168.100.10/24`)
    * **Gateway:** VMware's NAT gateway (e.g., `192.168.100.2`)
    * **DNS:** You can use public DNS like `8.8.8.8` (Google) or `1.1.1.1` (Cloudflare).

**C. Accessing the VM:**

1.  **From your Host Laptop (most common):**
    You will *always* connect to your VM using its static IP address within the NAT network.
    * Example: `ssh username@192.168.100.10`
    * This IP will never change, regardless of where your laptop is.

2.  **From Other Devices on the *Same Physical Network* as your Laptop (e.g., another PC in your home network):**
    This requires **Port Forwarding on your Host Laptop (within VMware Workstation)**.
    * In VMware Workstation, go to your VM's **Network Adapter** settings (ensure it's NAT).
    * Click the **"Port Forwarding"** button (or similar in VMware Fusion/Workstation Pro, it's usually under NAT settings in Virtual Network Editor).
    * Add a rule:
        * **Host Port:** `2222` (or any other unused port on your host, *not* 22 to avoid conflicts)
        * **Virtual Machine IP:** `192.168.100.10` (your VM's static IP)
        * **Virtual Machine Port:** `22` (or your service's port, e.g., `3306` for MySQL)
        * **Protocol:** TCP
    * Now, from another device on your *local network*, you would connect to your **Host Laptop's current IP address** on the **Host Port** you just configured.
        * Example: If your laptop's current Wi-Fi IP is `192.168.1.50`, then from another PC: `ssh username@192.168.1.50 -p 2222`
    * **The downside:** Your laptop's `192.168.1.50` IP will change when you move networks. So, you'd need to find your laptop's current IP each time if you want to connect from *other local devices*.
