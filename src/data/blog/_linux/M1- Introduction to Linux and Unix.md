# **Linux Terminal Overview**

---

## **1. What is the Linux Shell?**

### **Definition**:

The **Linux shell** is an **OS-level application** that interprets and executes commands entered by a user.

### **Key Points**:

- In early Unix/Linux systems, the **shell was the only interface** available.
- Today, GUIs exist, but the shell remains a powerful and flexible tool.
- It allows users to:
  - Run programs
  - Manipulate files (copy, move, delete)
  - Read/write data
  - Search and filter content
- Can also be used for **scripting**, automating repetitive tasks.

### **Popular Shells**:

- **Bash** (Bourne Again SHell) – Most widely used.
- **Zsh** (Z Shell) – More modern features and customization.

---

## **2. What is the Linux Terminal?**

### **Definition**:

A **terminal** is an application or interface where you type commands and view their output.

### **How It Works**:

- You enter commands in the terminal.
- The terminal sends them to the **shell** for execution.
- The shell communicates with the OS and hardware.
- Results are returned to the terminal for display.

> Example:

```bash
python myprogram.py
```

This runs a Python script called `myprogram.py` and displays its output (e.g., “Hello, World!”).

---

## **3. How Terminal and Shell Work Together**

### **Step-by-Step Execution Flow**:

1. **User** types a command in the terminal.
2. **Terminal** sends the command to the **shell**.
3. **Shell** interprets the command and communicates with the **operating system** and **kernel**.
4. **Kernel** interacts with **hardware** to execute the task.
5. Once completed, results are passed back through the chain to the **terminal**, where they are displayed to the user.

---

## **4. Understanding the Command Line Interface (CLI)**

### **Command Prompt**:

- The blinking cursor where you type your commands.
- Often shows the **current working directory**.
- Example prompt:
  ```
  /home/me/Documents $
  ```

### **Current Working Directory**:

- This is the directory where the shell will look for files or run commands.
- You can change it using the `cd` command.

---

## **5. Navigating the Filesystem Using the Terminal**

### **Basic Commands for Navigation**:

| Command                 | Description                                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `cd /`                  | Move to the **root directory** (`/`)                |
| `cd bin`                | Move into the `bin` directory from current location |
| `cd ~`                  | Go to the **user’s home directory**                 |
| `cd ..`                 | Move up one level to the **parent directory**       |
| `cd ../..`              | Move up two levels in the directory tree            |
| `cd /home/me/Documents` | Navigate directly to a specific path                |

---

## **6. Understanding Paths in Linux**

### **Path**:

A **human-readable location** of a file or directory in the filesystem.

### **Types of Path Notation**:

| Symbol | Meaning               | Example               |
| ------ | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| `/`    | Root directory        | `/home/user/file.txt` |
| `~`    | User's home directory | `~/Documents`         |
| `.`    | Current directory     | `./file.txt`          |
| `..`   | Parent directory      | `../other_folder`     |

> Path structure uses forward slashes:  
> Example: `a/b` means "b" is inside "a".

---

## **7. Listing Files and Running Programs**

### **List Files in Current Directory**:

```bash
ls
```

- Displays all files and directories in the current folder.

### **Run an Executable File**:

```bash
./ls
```

- Runs the `ls` program located in the current directory.

> Note: Many commands like `ls` are built into the shell and don’t require `./`.

---

## **8. Practical Examples**

### **Example 1: Navigating to the Home Directory**

```bash
cd ~
```

Even if `ls` isn't in the current directory, you can still use it because it's part of the system PATH.

### **Example 2: Moving Up and Down the Filesystem**

```bash
cd ../..
```

Moves up two levels in the directory hierarchy.

```bash
cd /home/me/Documents
```

Navigates directly to the Documents folder.

### **Example 3: Running a Python Script**

```bash
cd /home/me
python myprogram.py
```

Runs a Python script named `myprogram.py` located in the current directory.

| Move to specific path              | `cd /home/me/Documents` |
| List contents of current directory | `ls`                    |
| Run a Python script                | `python myprogram.py`   |

---

### Exercise 1 - Browsing Directories with `ls`

In this exercise, you're learning how to navigate and view the contents of directories using the `ls` command in a Linux shell environment.

---

### 📌 **Summary of Key Concepts**

#### 🔹 What is `ls`?

- `ls` is a **command** used to **list directory contents**.
- It is actually a program located at `/bin/ls`.
- When you type `ls`, the shell runs `/bin/ls` to show files and folders in the current or specified directory.

---

### ✅ **1.1 Viewing Files in the Current Working Directory**

**Command:**

```bash
ls
```

**Explanation:**

- This lists all files and directories in your **current working directory**.
- In this lab environment, your current directory is `/home/project`.
- Since it's empty, running `ls` returns nothing (no output).

---

### ✅ **1.2 Viewing Files in Any Directory**

You can list the contents of any directory by specifying its **path**:

**Command:**

```bash
ls [PATH TO DIRECTORY]
```

#### Example:

```bash
ls /
```

- Lists the contents of the **root directory (`/`)**.

#### Common System Directories:

| Directory | Contents                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/bin`    | Essential user command binaries (like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`) |
| `/sbin`   | System administration binaries                          |
| `/usr`    | User programs and data                                  |
| `/home`   | Home directories for users                              |
| `/media`  | Mount points for removable media                        |

---

### 🧪 Try These Commands

To explore the system, try these in your terminal:

```bash
ls /              # List root directory contents
ls /bin           # List commands available in /bin
ls /home          # See what users exist (you may see 'project')
ls /etc           # Configuration files
ls /usr/bin       # More user-level command binaries
```

---

### 💡 Tip

- If you want to see **hidden files** (those starting with a dot), use:

  ```bash
  ls -a
  ```

- To get a **detailed list** (including file permissions, size, owner, etc.):
  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```

---

### Exercise 2 - Navigating Directories with `cd`

In this exercise, you're learning how to **change directories** using the `cd` (change directory) command in a Linux shell.

---

### 🧭 Key Navigation Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning                              | Example                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `~`    | Your **home directory**              | `cd ~` goes to `/home/theia` |
| `/`    | The **root directory** of the system | `cd /`                       |
| `.`    | The **current directory**            | `cd .` stays where you are   |
| `..`   | The **parent directory**             | `cd ..` moves up one level   |

---

### ✅ **2.1 Changing to Your Home Directory**

```bash
cd ~
```

- This takes you to your **default home directory**, which is typically `/home/theia` in this lab environment.
- To confirm:
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```

---

### ✅ **2.2 Going to the Parent Directory**

```bash
cd ..
```

- Moves **up one level** in the directory hierarchy.
- Example: If you're in `/home/theia`, this will take you to `/home`.

---

### ✅ **2.3 Changing to the Root Directory**

```bash
cd /
```

- Takes you to the **top-level directory** of the file system, called the **root directory**.

---

### ✅ **2.4 Changing to a Child Directory**

#### Method 1: Relative Path

```bash
cd bin
```

- From `/`, this will go to `/bin`.
- Assumes `bin` is a subdirectory of your current working directory.

#### Method 2: Using `.` (Current Directory)

```bash
cd ./bin
```

- Also changes to `/bin` if you're currently in `/`.

> ⚠️ Tip: Make sure you're in the correct parent directory before navigating into a child directory. If you're already in `/bin`, typing `cd ./bin` would try to go to `/bin/bin`, which may not exist.

---

### ✅ **2.5 Returning to Your Home Directory**

#### Option 1: Using `~` (Fastest Way)

```bash
cd ~
```

- Directly returns you to `/home/theia`.

#### Option 2: Using Relative Path

```bash
cd ../home/theia
```

- Goes up to `/home`, then into the `theia` folder.

---

### ✅ **2.6 Navigating to the Project Directory**

```bash
cd ../project
```

- This switches you from `/home/theia` to its **sibling directory**: `/home/project`.
- Useful for moving between related folders inside `/home`.

---

### 📌 Final Tips

- Use `pwd` (Print Working Directory) often to see where you are:
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```
- Combine paths using slashes:
  ```bash
  cd /home/project/myfolder
  ```
- Tab completion helps! Start typing a directory name and press **Tab** to auto-complete.

---

### Exercise 3 - Using **Tab Completion** and **Command History**

In this exercise, you learned two powerful tools to make working in the terminal **faster**, **easier**, and **less error-prone**:

- 🔁 **Command history**
- ✨ **Tab completion**

---

## 🔄 3.1 Scrolling Through Command History

You can easily **review and reuse** previously entered commands using:

| Key              | Action                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| `↑` (Up Arrow)   | Go back one command    |
| `↓` (Down Arrow) | Go forward one command |

### Example:

If you previously typed:

```bash
cd /
cd bin
ls
```

Then pressing `↑` will bring back `ls`, then `cd bin`, then `cd /`, etc.

### Use Case:

Let's say you want to run `cd bin` again:

- Instead of retyping it, press `↑` until you see `cd bin`
- Press `Enter` to execute it again

> 💡 If the command doesn't work because your current directory changed, keep scrolling until you find `cd /`, run that first, then try `cd bin`.

---

## 🧠 3.2 Using Tab Completion

**Tab completion** helps you type faster by auto-filling file and directory names.

### How It Works:

#### Step-by-step example:

1. Type:
   ```bash
   cd /bi
   ```
2. Press **`Tab`**
   - It autocompletes to:
     ```bash
     cd /bin
     ```

#### What if there are multiple matches?

Try typing:

```bash
cd /b
```

Then press **`Tab`** once → nothing happens  
Press **`Tab`** twice → You'll see options like:

```
bin/   boot/
```

Now add an `i`:

```bash
cd /bi
```

Press **`Tab`** again → completes to:

```bash
cd /bin
```

### Tip:

- **Double-tab (`Tab + Tab`)** shows all possible completions.
- Only works when there’s **one match** or you're asking for help with ambiguous paths.

---

## 🛠️ Practice: Digging Into a Path Using Tab Completion

Let’s build a longer command using tab completion:

Start typing:

```bash
ls /ho
```

Press **Tab** → becomes:

```bash
ls /home/
```

Now type:

```bash
ls /home/the
```

Press **Tab** → becomes:

```bash
ls /home/theia
```

Keep going:

```bash
ls /home/theia/dsdriver/bi
```

Press **Tab** → becomes:

```bash
ls /home/theia/dsdriver/bin
```

This way, you built:

```bash
ls /home/theia/dsdriver/bin
```

...without typing the whole thing!

## 🏗️ **The Five Layers of Linux Architecture**

1. **User Interface (UI)**: Where users interact with applications.
2. **Applications**: Programs used to perform tasks (e.g., browsers, editors).
3. **Operating System**: Manages system resources and ensures smooth operation.
4. **Kernel**: The core of Linux; handles communication between software and hardware.
5. **Hardware**: Physical components like CPU, memory, disk drives.

> Everything runs on top of the **kernel**, which is the bridge between your apps and your computer’s physical components.

---

## 📁 **Filesystem Overview**

- Linux uses a **tree-like hierarchical filesystem**.
- Starts from the **root directory (`/`)**.
- Common directories:
  - `/bin` – essential commands
  - `/etc` – configuration files
  - `/home` – user directories
  - `/usr` – user programs
  - `/var` – variable data (logs, caches)

---

## 🖥️ **Shell and Terminal Basics**

- A **shell** is a command-line interpreter (e.g., Bash).
- You interact with the shell via a **terminal emulator**.
- Key navigation commands:
  - `cd` – change directory
  - `ls` – list contents
  - `pwd` – show current path
  - `man` – view manual pages

---

## ✍️ **Text Editors in Linux**

You can edit files using:

- 🖋️ Command-line editors:
  - `nano` – beginner-friendly
  - `vim` / `vi` – powerful but has a learning curve
- 🖼️ GUI-based editors:
  - `gedit`
  - `Kate`
  - VS Code (available on Linux)

---

## 📦 **Package Management**

Two major package formats:

- `.deb` – used by Debian, Ubuntu, and derivatives
- `.rpm` – used by Red Hat, Fedora, SUSE, and others

Common package managers:

- **APT** (Advanced Packaging Tool) – used in Debian/Ubuntu
- **YUM/DNF** – used in RHEL/Fedora

Basic commands:

```bash
sudo apt update       # Update package list
sudo apt upgrade      # Upgrade packages
sudo apt install      # Install new packages
```
