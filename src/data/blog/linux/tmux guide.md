#  Mastering Tmux - The Essential Guide for Persistent Cloud Sessions

Stop losing work! Learn how to use tmux to keep long-running processes alive on a cloud server, even after your SSH connection drops. Complete beginner's guide to sessions, windows, and panes.

## Part 1: Tmux Fundamentals and Session Persistence

### 1\. What is Tmux?

Tmux is a **terminal multiplexer**. It creates a persistent shell that runs on your cloud server, independent of your local SSH connection.

| Feature | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Persistence** | Processes continue to run after you disconnect. |
| **Resilience** | Your work is safe from unstable Wi-Fi or accidental shutdowns. |
| **Organization** | Manage multiple terminal windows and splits within a single session. |

### 2\. Installation

Install tmux on your cloud server using your distribution's package manager:

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt update && sudo apt install tmux

# For CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install tmux
```

### 3\. The Prefix Key

All tmux keyboard shortcuts start with the **Prefix Key**: **`Ctrl + b`**. Press and release this combination before any command key.

### 4\. Session Management: Named vs. Unnamed

Tmux sessions can be handled in two ways: named (recommended for clarity) or unnamed (automatically numbered).

| Action | Named Session (e.g., `myproject`) | Unnamed Session (e.g., `0`, `1`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Create New** | `tmux new -s myproject` (Long) / `tmux new -s myproject` (Short) | `tmux new` (Long) / `tmux` (Shortest) |
| **Detach** | `Ctrl + b` then `d` | `Ctrl + b` then `d` |
| **List All** | `tmux list-sessions` (Long) / `tmux ls` (Short) | `tmux list-sessions` (Long) / `tmux ls` (Short) |
| **Reattach** | `tmux attach -t myproject` (Long) / `tmux a -t myproject` (Short) | `tmux attach -t 0` (Long) / `tmux a -t 0` (Short) |
| **Reattach (First Available)** | N/A | `tmux attach` (Long) / `tmux a` (Short) |

**Note on Unnamed Reattach:** If you have multiple unnamed sessions (e.g., `0`, `1`, `2`), you **must** use the `-t` flag with the specific number (`tmux a -t 2`). If you only use `tmux a` with multiple sessions, it will usually connect to the oldest or numerically lowest one.

### 5\. Running Your Process

Once you are inside a session (named or unnamed), you can safely run any long command:
- Example: Start a training script
```bash
python3 train_model.py # This process will continue after you detach!
```

### 6\. Killing a Session

When your process is complete, you should terminate the session to free up resources.

| Method | Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| **From Outside** | `tmux kill-session -t [name or number]` |
| **From Inside** (If only one pane exists) | `Ctrl + b` then **`x`** (then confirm with **`y`**) |

## Part 2: Advanced Organization with Windows and Panes

Tmux allows you to organize your terminal space using two main levels of hierarchy: **Windows** (like tabs) and **Panes** (like split screens).

### 1\. Window Management (The Tabs)

| Task | Shortcut (After `Ctrl + b`) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Create New Window** | **`c`** | Creates a new, empty window and switches you to it. |
| **Switch to Next Window** | **`n`** | Moves to the window with the next sequential number. |
| **Switch by Index** | **`0`** to **`9`** | Directly switches to the window by its number. |
| **List Windows** | **`w`** | Opens an interactive list of all windows in the session. |
| **Rename Window** | **`,`** (Comma) | Opens the command prompt to type a new name. |
| **Close (Kill) Window** | **`&`** (Ampersand) | Kills the current window and all panes inside it (Requires confirmation: **`y`**). |

### 2\. Pane Management (The Splits)

Panes split a single window into multiple independent terminal views (e.g., viewing logs while editing code).

| Task | Shortcut (After `Ctrl + b`) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Split Vertically** | **`%`** (Percent) | Splits the current pane into two side-by-side (left/right). An older way |
| **Split Vertically** | **`v`** (v) | Divides the current pane into two panes side-by-side. (left/right). |
| **Split Horizontally** | **`"`** (Double Quote) | Splits the current pane into a top and bottom pane. |
| **Switch Panes** | **`<Arrow Key>`** | Changes focus to the adjacent pane. |
| **Zoom Pane** | **`z`** | Toggles the active pane to fill the entire window temporarily. |
| **Close (Kill) Pane** | **`x`** (Letter X) | Kills the currently active pane (Requires confirmation: **`y`**). |

## Summary: Why Tmux is Essential

Tmux is the ultimate safety net for every remote professional. Using a named session for a specific project allows you to guarantee that your long-running script, training job, or migration will never be terminated by an unstable network connection. It transforms your server connection into a reliable, multi-tasking workspace.
