---

# Install the 7 different Desktop Environment with XRDP in single ubuntu server.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1.  An **Ubuntu Server** instance (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or 22.04 LTS) running in the cloud.
2.  **SSH access** to the server with a user that has `sudo` privileges.

## The Linux GUI Landscape—Desktop Environments

Linux DEs cater to every taste, whether you prioritize eye-candy, low resource usage, or a classic, familiar layout. Below are the top contenders, including the popular **KDE Plasma** (which Kubuntu uses) and many others.

### The Big Four: Power, Style, and Efficiency

| Desktop Environment | Focus & Key Feature | Best Suited For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **KDE Plasma** | **Power & Customization.** Highly modern, feature-rich, and visually stunning. Offers deep control over every aspect of the desktop. | Power users, Windows switchers, and anyone who loves to **tinker** and customize their UI. |
| **GNOME** | **Simplicity & Modernity.** A clean, minimalist interface focused on keyboard shortcuts and the "Activities" overview. | Users seeking a modern, distraction-free workflow, often found as the default on Ubuntu and Fedora. |
| **Cinnamon** | **Traditional Layout & Stability.** A classic, comfortable desktop that closely mimics the Windows 7/XP experience. | Beginners and Windows switchers who want a familiar, immediate, and highly stable experience (default on Linux Mint). |
| **XFCE** | **Lightweight & Fast.** Extremely resource-friendly and highly stable. It sacrifices some modern visual flair for pure speed. | Older hardware, virtual machines (VMs), or users prioritizing speed and low RAM/CPU usage. |

### The Specialized & Lightweight Options

  * **MATE:** A continuation of the classic **GNOME 2** desktop. It's stable, traditional, and lightweight, ideal for users nostalgic for older Linux versions.
  * **LXQt:** The combination of the lightweight **LXDE** and the **Qt** framework. It is one of the absolute lightest DEs, perfect for very low-power devices.
  * **Pantheon:** The elegant desktop environment from Elementary OS. Known for its curated, macOS-like aesthetic and focus on polished, integrated applications.
  * **Budgie:** Developed by the Solus project, it balances elegance and modern features with a focus on simplicity. It features a unique sidebar called **Raven** for notifications and settings.
  * **Deepin Desktop Environment (DDE):** Highly praised for its stunning, animated design and unique control center sidebar, often compared to macOS in terms of visual polish.

## Install XRDP and XFCE

First, we'll update the system, install the necessary XRDP service, and then install the XFCE desktop environment.

1.  **Update your system packages:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```

2.  **Install the XRDP service:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt install xrdp -y
    ```

3.  **Install the Desktop Environment and Configure:**
    **Configure the user's session:**
    Create or edit the `.xsession` file in the home directory of the user you will use to connect. This file tells XRDP which desktop to launch.

---

- Install XFCE DEs:
```bash
sudo apt install xfce4 -y 
sudo apt install xubuntu-desktop -y # The full Xubuntu experience.
```

```bash
echo xfce4-session > ~/.xsession
echo startxfce4 > ~/.xsession
```

![output](@/assets/images/Screenshot_20251031_172654.png)


---

- Install LXQt DEs:
```bash
sudo apt install lxqt -y # The full Lubuntu (now LXQt-based) experience.
sudo apt install lubuntu-desktop -y # The full Lubuntu (now LXQt-based) experience.
```

```bash
echo startlxqt > ~/.xsession
```
![output](@/assets/images/Screenshot_20251031_165528.png)

---

- Install MATE DEs:
```bash
sudo apt install ubuntu-mate-desktop -y # The full Ubuntu MATE experience.
sudo apt install mate-desktop-environment -y # A more standard MATE install.
sudo apt install mate-session-manager -y # Installs the core session manager.
```

```bash
echo mate-session > ~/.xsession
```

![output](@/assets/images/Screenshot_20251031_171435.png)

---

- Install Cinnamon DEs:
```bash
sudo apt install cinnamon-desktop-environment -y # Standard Cinnamon installation.
sudo apt install cinnamon -y # Installs the core Cinnamon package.
```

```bash
echo cinnamon-session > ~/.xsession
```

![output](@/assets/images/Screenshot_20251031_173606.png)

---

- Install Enlightenment (E) DEs:
```bash
sudo apt install enlightenment -y # A unique, lightweight, and fast DE/WM.
```

```bash
echo enlightenment_start > ~/.xsession
```

![output](@/assets/images/Screenshot_20251031_174205.png)

---

- Install Gnome DEs:
```bash
sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop -y # The full, default Ubuntu experience.
sudo apt install gnome-session # Installs the core session manager.
sudo apt install gnome-core # Installs a minimal GNOME experience.
```
```bash
echo gnome-session > ~/.xsession
```

![output](@/assets/images/Screenshot_20251101_110535.png)

---

- Install KDE Plasma DEs:
```bash
sudo apt install kubuntu-desktop -y # The full Kubuntu experience.
sudo apt install plasma-desktop # Installs a more basic version of Plasma.
sudo apt install gkde-plasma-desktop # Minimal
```
```bash
echo startplasma-x11 > ~/.xsession
```

![output](@/assets/images/Screenshot_20251101_123423.png)

---

2.  **Set correct permissions** for the `.xsession` file:

    ```bash
    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /home/$USER/.xsession
    chmod +x ~/.xsession
    ```

3.  **Add the XRDP user to the `ssl-cert` group** (essential for secure operation):
    ```bash
    sudo adduser xrdp ssl-cert
    ```

4.  **Restart the XRDP service** to load the new configuration:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart xrdp
    ```

5. Check the Status of `display-manager.service`

    Systemd uses a generic service unit named `display-manager.service` which is a symbolic link to the actual Display Manager service installed (e.g., `gdm.service`, `lightdm.service`, or `sddm.service`).

    Run this command to see which DM is active:

    ```bash
    systemctl status display-manager.service
    pgrep -l -f "(gdm|lightdm|sddm|kdm|lxdm)"
 
 6. Set the system to boot into graphical mode by default

After installation, your server is still set to boot into command-line mode (`multi-user.target`). We need to switch it to boot into the graphical mode (`graphical.target`).

```bash
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
```

-----

## Configure the Firewall

The default RDP port is **3389**. You must open this port in your server's firewall to allow incoming connections.

If you are using **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)**, run this command:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 3389/tcp
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw reload
```

*(**Note:** If your cloud provider uses its own firewall rules (Security Groups), you must also ensure port 3389 is open there.)*

-----

## Connect with an RDP Client

You are now ready to connect\! Use your favorite **RDP client** on your local machine (Windows Remote Desktop Connection, Remmina, Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac, etc.).

| Setting | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Computer/Server** | Your server's public IP address or hostname. |
| **Port** | 3389 (default RDP port). |
| **Session** | Leave as default or select "Xorg" if prompted. |
| **Username & Password** | The credentials of the Ubuntu user you configured. |


You should now be presented with a responsive, high-performance XFCE desktop, giving you a full graphical interface on your cloud server without the resource overhead\!

# Learn More:

## 💻 `~/.xinitrc` (X-Init RC)

* **Usage Context:** Primarily used when you start the X session **manually** from a text console using the command `startx` (which is a wrapper script for `xinit`).
* **Purpose:** It's the startup script for the `xinit` program.
* **Contents:** It's responsible for setting up the basic X environment (like resources, keyboard settings) and, critically, **launching the core component of your graphical session**, typically a Window Manager (WM) or a Desktop Environment (DE).
* **Execution Flow:**
    1.  You log in to a text console.
    2.  You run the command `startx`.
    3.  `startx` calls `xinit`, which looks for `~/.xinitrc`.
    4.  The script runs. **The X session remains active as long as the last command in `~/.xinitrc` is running.** This last command is usually the WM/DE, often started with `exec` (e.g., `exec startxfce4` or `exec i3`).
    5.  When the WM/DE exits, the script terminates, and `xinit` kills the X server, returning you to the text console.

---

## 🖥️ `~/.xsession` (X-Session)

* **Usage Context:** Primarily used when you log in through a **Display Manager (DM)**, such as GDM, LightDM, SDDM, or KDM (the graphical login screen).
* **Purpose:** It's the startup script used by the display manager to initialize the user's custom graphical session.
* **Contents:** It serves a similar role to `~/.xinitrc`—it sets up the environment and launches the session's Window Manager or Desktop Environment. However, on some distributions (like Debian), the system's `Xsession` script may be designed to be a **unified startup point** that handles both `startx` and DM logins, often by sourcing the user's `~/.xsession` file.
* **Execution Flow:**
    1.  The Display Manager is already running and shows a graphical login screen.
    2.  You log in.
    3.  The Display Manager runs a system-wide `/etc/X11/Xsession` script, which then looks for and executes or sources the user's `~/.xsession` file.
    4.  The script launches the WM/DE.

---

## 🎯 Summary Table

| Feature | `~/.xinitrc` | `~/.xsession` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trigger** | Manual start via `xinit` or `startx`. | Graphical login via a **Display Manager** (DM). |
| **Core Program** | `xinit` (or `startx` wrapper). | System-wide `Xsession` script (called by the DM). |
| **Typical Use** | Custom, minimal, or tiling Window Manager setups. | Desktop Environment (DE) or custom sessions via DM. |

**Note:** On modern systems and in many distributions (especially Debian-based ones), the system-wide `/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc` file often calls the system-wide `/etc/X11/Xsession` script. This convergence is an attempt to **unify the startup process** so that your graphical environment is consistent whether you use `startx` or a Display Manager, often relying more heavily on `~/.xsession` for user customization.


### 1\. Check Current Display Manager

You can usually check the currently configured Display Manager using one of these commands:

  * **Systemd-based systems:**
    ```bash
    systemctl status display-manager.service
    ```
    This command will show which service is symlinked to `display-manager.service` and its status.
  * **Debian/Ubuntu systems:**
    ```bash
    cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager
    ```
    This file often contains the path to the executable of the currently set default DM.

-----

### 2\. Change the Default Display Manager

The method for changing the DM depends on your Linux distribution:

#### A. Debian/Ubuntu-based Systems (using `dpkg-reconfigure`)

If you have multiple DMs installed (e.g., `gdm3`, `lightdm`, `sddm`), you can use the `dpkg-reconfigure` utility, which will prompt you to select the default one from a list:

1.  Run the command, replacing `gdm3` with the name of any installed Display Manager package:
    ```bash
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm3 
    ```
      * This will bring up a configuration screen where you can select your preferred DM (e.g., LightDM, SDDM) using the arrow keys and pressing **Enter**.
2.  **Reboot** the system for the change to take effect:
    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

#### B. Systemd-based Systems (using `systemctl` for generic DMs)

On distributions that primarily rely on systemd services (like Arch, Fedora, etc.), you manage the default DM by **disabling** the old service and **enabling** the new one. This assumes the new DM is already installed.

1.  **Disable** the currently enabled DM service (e.g., GDM):
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl disable gdm.service
    ```
2.  **Enable** the new DM service (e.g., LightDM or SDDM):
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable lightdm.service 
    # OR
    sudo systemctl enable sddm.service
    ```
      * You might need to use the `--force` flag if an existing `display-manager.service` symlink needs to be overridden.
3.  **Start** the new DM, or **reboot** the system:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start lightdm.service
    # OR
    sudo reboot
    ```

The Display Manager you choose will typically be responsible for presenting the graphical login screen and launching the selected **Desktop Environment (DE)**, which is why the terms are sometimes confused. Common DMs include **GDM** (for GNOME), **LightDM** (for Xfce, LXDE, Unity), and **SDDM** (for KDE Plasma, LXQt).
