# Essential Linux Terminal Key Bindings for Efficient Command Line Editing

Mastering terminal key bindings is one of the fastest ways to improve your command-line efficiency. These shortcuts allow you to navigate, edit, and control your terminal sessions with speed and precision.

These bindings are primarily for the **Bash** and **Zsh** shells, which are the most common defaults.

## Cursor Navigation

| Key Binding | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Ctrl + A` | Move cursor to the **Beginning** of the line. |
| `Ctrl + E` | Move cursor to the **End** of the line. |
| `Alt + B` | Move cursor **Back** one word. |
| `Alt + F` | Move cursor **Forward** one word. |
| `Ctrl + B` | Move cursor **Back** one character (same as Left Arrow). |
| `Ctrl + F` | Move cursor **Forward** one character (same as Right Arrow). |

## Text Editing

| Key Binding | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Ctrl + U` | **Cut/Kill** from cursor to the beginning of the line. |
| `Ctrl + K` | **Cut/Kill** from cursor to the end of the line. |
| `Ctrl + W` | **Cut/Kill** the word before the cursor. |
| `Alt + D` | **Cut/Kill** the word after the cursor. |
| `Ctrl + Y` | **Paste (Yank)** the last killed text. |
| `Ctrl + D` | **Delete** the character under the cursor (Exit shell if line is empty). |
| `Ctrl + H` | **Delete** the character before the cursor (Backspace). |
| `Ctrl + T` | **Swap** the current character with the previous one. |
| `Alt + T` | **Swap** the current word with the previous one. |
| `Ctrl + _` | **Undo** the last edit. |

## Process Control

| Key Binding | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Ctrl + C` | **Interrupt/Kill** the current foreground process. |
| `Ctrl + Z` | **Suspend** the current process (resume with `fg` or `bg`). |
| `Ctrl + D` | **Exit** the current shell (End-of-File). |
| `Ctrl + L` | **Clear** the terminal screen (same as `clear` command). |
| `Ctrl + S` | **Pause** terminal output (lock the screen). |
| `Ctrl + Q` | **Resume** terminal output (unlock the screen). |

## History Commands

| Key Binding | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Ctrl + R` | **Reverse Search** through command history. |
| `Ctrl + G` | **Escape** from history search mode. |
| `Up Arrow` | Navigate **backward** through history. |
| `Down Arrow` | Navigate **forward** through history. |
| `Ctrl + P` | Previous command in history (same as Up Arrow). |
| `Ctrl + N` | Next command in history (same as Down Arrow). |
| `!!` | **Repeat** the last command. |
| `!<word>` | Repeat the last command that started with `<word>`. |

## Tab Completion

| Key Binding | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Tab` | **Auto-complete** file, command, or directory name. |
| `Tab Tab` (Press twice) | Show all possible completions when ambiguous. |
| `Alt + *` | Insert all possible completions (useful for seeing files). |

## Tips for Mastery

*   **`Alt` Key Note:** If `Alt` doesn't work (e.g., on macOS), try using the `Esc` key instead. Press and release `Esc`, then press the following key (e.g., `Esc` then `B` for `Alt+B`).
*   The text you "cut" using `Ctrl+U`, `Ctrl+K`, etc., is stored in a **kill ring**. You can yank it back with `Ctrl+Y`.
*   Practice `Ctrl+R` for searching history; it's a massive time-saver for long or complex commands.

Integrating even a handful of these bindings into your daily workflow will dramatically speed up your interaction with the Linux terminal.
