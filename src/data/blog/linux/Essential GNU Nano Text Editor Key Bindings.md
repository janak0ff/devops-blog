# Essential GNU Nano Text Editor Key Bindings

Nano is a user-friendly, command-line text editor known for its simplicity. Its key bindings are displayed at the bottom of the screen, but knowing the most useful ones by heart will make you much faster.

> **Note:** In Nano, the `^` symbol represents the **Ctrl** key. So `^X` means `Ctrl+X`. The `M-` symbol represents the **Meta** key, which is usually **Alt** or **Esc**.

## Basic File Operations

| `Ctrl + O` | **Write (Save)** the current file to disk. You will be prompted for a filename. |
| `Ctrl + S` | **Save** the file without prompting (works in many cases). |
| `Ctrl + R` | **Insert** another file into the current one. |
| `Ctrl + T` | **Spell Check** the text (if spell check is supported). |

| `Ctrl + _` | **Go to** specific line and column number. |
| `Ctrl + \` | **Search** for a string (pattern). `Alt + W` to find next. |

## Text Editing

| Key Binding | Description |

| `Alt + U` | **Undo** the last action. |

## Pro Tips for Nano

*   **The Ultimate Shortcut:** Press `Ctrl + G` to open the full help menu anytime you forget a command.
*   **Multiple Cuts:** You can press `Ctrl + K` multiple times in a row to cut multiple lines, and then paste them all at once with a single `Ctrl + U`.
*   **Navigation Confusion?** Remember the mnemonics: `P` for Previous (up), `N` for Next (down). `F`=Forward, `B`=Backward.
*   **To Save and Exit Quickly:** It's just two keys: `Ctrl + X` followed by `Y` (for Yes) and then `Enter` to confirm the filename.

These bindings will help you navigate and edit files in Nano with much greater speed and confidence.
