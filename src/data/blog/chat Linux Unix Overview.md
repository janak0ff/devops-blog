Welcome to Linux Distributions. After watching this video, you will be able to: Describe what a Linux distribution is. Differentiate between some common Linux distributions. And identify the use cases of some popular Linux distributions. So, what is a Linux distribution? A Linux distribution is a specific flavor of the Linux operating system. It may also be referred to as a distro. All Linux distributions must use the Linux kernel. This is the core component of the Linux operating system that enables the system to properly use the computer's hardware. And today, there are hundreds of Linux distros, each tailored for a specific audience or task. Okay, so what differentiates Linux distros from each other? Each Linux distro includes a unique set of default utilities that are part of the operating system, such as commands and applications that come prepackaged with the distribution. Each distro has its own graphical user interface, or GUI, that you use to interact with the operating system. Each distro supports a specific set of commands that you can use in a shell, a window for entering and receiving output from commands. And lastly, each distro provides differing levels of support. It could be developed and managed as a community-backed project or maintained by a commercial enterprise. And it could be a long-term support version, or LTS, or a rolling release, where stable package updates are released on a rolling schedule. Debian is one of the earliest-rooted distros, with the first release in 1993 (named version 0.01) and the first official, stable release in 1996 (version 1.1). It is known for being stable, reliable, and fully open source. It supports many computer architectures (or types of hardware). These features result in Debian being highly regarded in the server space. And furthermore, Debian is the largest community-run distro currently available. Another popular distro is Ubuntu. This is also an early-rooted distro, with its first official release in 2004. Ubuntu is Debian-based, meaning that it’s built on top of Debian and uses a lot of the same tools as the Debian OS. Ubuntu is developed and managed by Canonical. And Ubuntu has three official editions: Desktop (for personal computers, laptops, and workstations) Server (for simple file servers or multinode clouds) and Core (for the Internet of Things). Red Hat Linux, like Debian, is a "core" Linux distro, meaning that it is not derived from another Linux distro. Red Hat is known for being stable, reliable, and fully open source. It’s managed by Red Hat, an IBM subsidiary. Today it ships as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (or RHEL), an edition focused entirely on enterprise customers. Next is Fedora, which is known as a stable operating system that supports many architectures. It’s also very reliable and secure, offering unique firewall and security features. It’s actively developed, with a large and growing community. And it’s sponsored by Red Hat. Consequently, Red Hat uses much of Fedora’s code base (after testing, of course). Another Linux distro is SUSE Linux Enterprise. Also known as SLE, SUSE Linux Enterprise is available in two editions: Server, or SLES, and Desktop, or SLED. It supports many architectures, such as ARM for Raspberry Pi, and uses the SUSE Package Hub, which enables users to install packages that aren’t officially part of SLE. And it's maintained by the small German open-source software company, SUSE. And finally, we have Arch Linux. The unique, do-it-yourself approach of Arch Linux allows users to customize every part of their system. This makes it highly configurable, a freedom that makes Arch very popular. But it also means that you need a strong understanding of Linux and system tools in order to use Arch effectively. And because Arch isn’t focused on stability in the same way as other distros, it has easy access to the newest software, which has little guarantee of being completely stable. In this video, you learned that: Linux distros can be differentiated by their user interfaces, their shell applications, and how the operating system is supported and built. The design of a Linux distro is catered toward a specific audience. Debian is highly regarded in the server space for its stability, reliability, and for being open source. Red Hat Enterprise Linux, an IBM subsidiary, is focused completely on enterprise customers. And SUSE Linux Enterprise supports many architectures, such as ARM for Raspberry Pi.

Welcome to “Overview of Linux Architecture.” After watching this video, you will be able to: List the layers in a Linux system. Explain the role of each layer in a Linux system. And describe the Linux filesystem. The Linux system comprises five distinct layers. The outermost layer of the Linux architecture is the UI, or user interface, which allows users to interact with the system using a keyboard or mouse. The application layer includes system daemons, shells, user apps, and tools used to perform tasks in a Linux system. The applications communicate with the operating system to perform tasks. The OS is responsible for jobs that are vital for system stability such as job scheduling and keeping track of time. All Linux operating systems are built on top of the Linux kernel, which performs the most vital lower-level jobs. The kernel is the core component of the operating system and is responsible for managing memory, processing, and security. The kernel interacts with the hardware layer, which includes all the physical or electronic devices in the computer such as processors, memory modules, input devices, and storage. The first layer in a Linux system is the user interface. The UI allows users to perform tasks by controlling applications with the keyboard. Desktop versions of Linux include a Graphical User Interface, or GUI layer, which is similar to Microsoft Windows. This extends the UI functionality to other control devices, such as a mouse. You might use a Linux machine to: Use a web browser to send your friend an email. Or use a music player to listen to your favorite song. Applications are the software that enables a user to perform a task in a Linux system. Applications can include the following: System tools, such as compilers. Programming languages. Shells, which are special applications that are often part of the operating system itself. And user apps, which can be any kind of applications, from browsers, to text editors, to games. The operating system controls the jobs and programs that are vital to system health and stability. Its functions also include: Assigning software to users, Detecting errors and implementing measures to prevent complete system failures, And performing file management. In a Linux system, the operating system is built on top of the Linux kernel, which performs the most vital operations. The kernel is the lowest-level software in a Linux system and has complete control of the system. It starts as soon as your computer boots and remains in your computer’s memory while the system is running. It also acts as a bridge between your apps and your machine hardware, enabling the two to communicate effectively using "system calls." The kernel has four key jobs: Memory management, Process management, Managing device drivers for proper hardware support, And assuring the system remains secure The final layer in the Linux system is the hardware, consisting of the physical or electronic devices that make up your computer. This layer can include the following: The central processing unit, or CPU, which is responsible for executing most calculations. The random access memory, or RAM, which is a fast storage unit used to hold the temporary information your applications need to run. Storage for data that needs to persist when your computer is powered off. Your computer's screen. And any USB devices such as a keyboard, mouse, or USB drive. The Linux filesystem is the collection of files on your machine. It includes the files needed to run the machine and applications as well as your own files containing your work. The top level of the filesystem is the root directory, symbolized by a forward slash (/). Below this is a tree-like structure of the directories and files in the system. And the filesystem assigns appropriate access rights to the directories and files. The very top of the Linux filesystem is the root directory, which contains many other directories and files. One of the key directories is /bin, which contains user binary files. Binary files contain the code your machine reads to run programs and execute commands. It’s called "slash bin" to signify that it exists directly below the root directory. Other key directories include /usr, which contains user programs, /home, which is your personal working directory where you should store all your personal files, /boot, which contains your system boot files, the instructions vital for system startup, and /media, which contains files related to temporary media such as CD or USB drives that are connected to the system. There are several other directories in the root directory, but you will not need to access them during this course. All the files and directories in a Linux system are organized into one of these designated folders, depending on the purpose of the file or directory. In this video, you learned that: A Linux system consists of five key layers. The user interface is the layer that enables the user to interact with applications using control devices​. Applications enable users to perform certain tasks within the system. The operating system runs on top of the Linux kernel and is vital for system health and stability. The kernel is the lowest-level software and enables applications to interact with your hardware. Hardware includes all the physical or electronic components of your PC. And the Linux filesystem is a tree-like structure consisting of all directories and files on the system.

Welcome to Linux Terminal Overview. After watching this video, you will be able to: Describe what the Linux shell is. Describe what a Linux terminal is. Explain how a Linux terminal and shell work together. And use a Linux terminal to navigate directories. The Linux shell is an OS-level application that interprets commands. In early versions of Unix and Linux, the shell was the only way to interact with the operating system. Today, you can also use graphical user interfaces, but the shell remains a popular and flexible choice and an easy way to run script files. You can use shell commands to perform tasks such as moving and copying files, writing to and reading from files, extracting and filtering data, and searching for data. There are many shell versions, but the base functionality of most is the same. Some popular examples include: Bash And Zsh. You interact with the Linux shell through a Linux terminal. A terminal is an application, or user interface, where you enter the commands you want to run and receive any output from those commands. For example, to start the Python application and run a program called ”myprogram.py", type python space myprogram.py. When you press Enter, the shell runs the command. This program prints the words “Hello, World!” to the terminal. So how are commands run? First, we have a user who wants to run a command. They enter the command in a terminal, which is then relayed to the shell. The core components of the operating system and kernel translate the command for the hardware to perform. When the hardware completes the command, the kernel reads any changes or results and sends them back via the shell to the terminal for the user’s information. The terminal is a powerful way to run applications and interact with your machine.

Most terminals have a similar user interface for you to enter commands. The area where you enter commands is called the command line. And the vertical line, or cursor, is the command prompt. This indicates where the text that you type will be displayed. In this example, the current working directory is the Documents directory, which is inside the me directory, which is inside the home directory. The current working directory is the location where the shell will look for any commands that you specify to run, for example, the Python program in the previous example. Not all terminals display the full location, or path, of your current directory, so some will just display Documents here. The path is the human-readable location of a directory or file in the Linux filesystem. The “a slash b” structure indicates that the file or directory named "b" is located inside the directory named "a". There are also special paths: A single tilde symbol refers to the user’s home directory. A single slash at the beginning of a path refers to the root directory. Two periods refer to the parent of the current directory. And a single period refers to the current directory. So, let’s look at how you can use the terminal to change the current working directory. You use the cd command that stands for change directory. Enter cd / to go to the root directory. And enter cd bin to move into the bin directory. The bin directory, which is inside root, contains programs required by the system. One of these programs, or executable files, is called “ls”. You can run the ls program in the current working directory by entering ./ls Use it to display in the terminal window the names of all files and directories within the current directory. Many commands located in the bin folder are also built into the shell, so you can run them from other locations too. Navigate to your home directory using cd ~ And even though the current working directory, /home/me, doesn't contain the ls program, you can still run the command successfully. Let's look at some more examples. Again, starting in the /home directory Enter "cd .." to change the current working directory to the parent of the existing current working directory. So, in this example the parent of /home is /, or the root directory. To then navigate to a USB drive called my-usb-drive in the media directory, enter cd /media/my-usb-drive.

You can also navigate up and down the tree in one command. To navigate up to the media directory then up to the root, enter cd ../.. and then to navigate down to the Documents directory in the me directory in the home directory, enter /home/me/Documents. Press Enter to submit the command and move to the Documents folder. Let’s move up to the /home/me directory, start the Python application, and run a program in the /home/me directory called myprogram.py.

# **Detailed Notes: Linux Terminal Overview**

---

## **1. What is the Linux Shell?**

### **Definition**:

The **Linux shell** is an **OS-level application** that interprets and executes commands entered by a user.

### **Key Points**:

- In early Unix/Linux systems, the **shell was the only interface** available.
- Today, GUIs exist, but the shell remains a powerful and flexible tool.
- It allows users to:
  - Run programs
  - Manipulate files (copy, move, delete)
  - Read/write data
  - Search and filter content
- Can also be used for **scripting**, automating repetitive tasks.

### **Popular Shells**:

- **Bash** (Bourne Again SHell) – Most widely used.
- **Zsh** (Z Shell) – More modern features and customization.

---

## **2. What is the Linux Terminal?**

### **Definition**:

A **terminal** is an application or interface where you type commands and view their output.

### **How It Works**:

- You enter commands in the terminal.
- The terminal sends them to the **shell** for execution.
- The shell communicates with the OS and hardware.
- Results are returned to the terminal for display.

> Example:

```bash
python myprogram.py
```

This runs a Python script called `myprogram.py` and displays its output (e.g., “Hello, World!”).

---

## **3. How Terminal and Shell Work Together**

### **Step-by-Step Execution Flow**:

1. **User** types a command in the terminal.
2. **Terminal** sends the command to the **shell**.
3. **Shell** interprets the command and communicates with the **operating system** and **kernel**.
4. **Kernel** interacts with **hardware** to execute the task.
5. Once completed, results are passed back through the chain to the **terminal**, where they are displayed to the user.

---

## **4. Understanding the Command Line Interface (CLI)**

### **Command Prompt**:

- The blinking cursor where you type your commands.
- Often shows the **current working directory**.
- Example prompt:
  ```
  /home/me/Documents $
  ```

### **Current Working Directory**:

- This is the directory where the shell will look for files or run commands.
- You can change it using the `cd` command.

---

## **5. Navigating the Filesystem Using the Terminal**

### **Basic Commands for Navigation**:

| Command                 | Description                                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `cd /`                  | Move to the **root directory** (`/`)                |
| `cd bin`                | Move into the `bin` directory from current location |
| `cd ~`                  | Go to the **user’s home directory**                 |
| `cd ..`                 | Move up one level to the **parent directory**       |
| `cd ../..`              | Move up two levels in the directory tree            |
| `cd /home/me/Documents` | Navigate directly to a specific path                |

---

## **6. Understanding Paths in Linux**

### **Path**:

A **human-readable location** of a file or directory in the filesystem.

### **Types of Path Notation**:

| Symbol | Meaning               | Example               |
| ------ | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| `/`    | Root directory        | `/home/user/file.txt` |
| `~`    | User's home directory | `~/Documents`         |
| `.`    | Current directory     | `./file.txt`          |
| `..`   | Parent directory      | `../other_folder`     |

> Path structure uses forward slashes:  
> Example: `a/b` means "b" is inside "a".

---

## **7. Listing Files and Running Programs**

### **List Files in Current Directory**:

```bash
ls
```

- Displays all files and directories in the current folder.

### **Run an Executable File**:

```bash
./ls
```

- Runs the `ls` program located in the current directory.

> Note: Many commands like `ls` are built into the shell and don’t require `./`.

---

## **8. Practical Examples**

### **Example 1: Navigating to the Home Directory**

```bash
cd ~
```

Even if `ls` isn't in the current directory, you can still use it because it's part of the system PATH.

### **Example 2: Moving Up and Down the Filesystem**

```bash
cd ../..
```

Moves up two levels in the directory hierarchy.

```bash
cd /home/me/Documents
```

Navigates directly to the Documents folder.

### **Example 3: Running a Python Script**

```bash
cd /home/me
python myprogram.py
```

Runs a Python script named `myprogram.py` located in the current directory.

---

## **9. Summary**

After watching this video, you should now understand:

✅ What the **Linux shell** is and how it interprets commands.  
✅ What a **terminal** is and how it serves as the interface for interacting with the shell.  
✅ How the **terminal and shell work together** to execute commands via the kernel and hardware.

Welcome to Creating and Editing Text Files. After watching this video, you will be able to: List popular text editors for Linux Describe a popular GUI-based text editor And use command-line editors to work with a file. You use text editors to write code in your Linux environment. There are many editors to choose from and they can be grouped into two main categories: Command-line text editors And GUI text editors Examples of command-line text editors are: GNU nano, a small and friendly modeless text editor vi, a traditional command-line editor originally created for Unix And vim, a powerful mode-based command line-editor based on vi A popular GUI-based editor is gedit, which is the default editor from the GNOME environment. And emacs (e’-max) is another text editor that is one of the oldest free, open source projects still under development. You can use emacs in GUI mode or within a command line. Gedit is a popular, modern text editor that comes preinstalled on most Linux distros. It’s designed as a general-purpose text editor and in keeping with the philosophy of the GNOME project, it emphasizes simplicity and ease of use, with a clean and simple GUI. Gedit provides many features to enhance your text editing experience, including: An integrated file browser Undo and redo functionality Search and replace functions with support for regular expressions in the search string And extensibility using plugins from the gedit-plugins package. The text editor uses syntax color coding to help you interpret and focus on different aspects of your code. GNU nano is a command-line text editor that provides: Undo and redo features Search and replace with support for regular expressions in the search string Syntax highlighting Automatic indentation of code Line numbering Line-by-line scrolling And multiple buffers so you can work with many files at the same time To open a text file in nano, type nano followed by the filename to open. This opens a new text editor window in which you can edit the file. Here is what the nano app looks like. The main area displays the text of the open file, which in this case is the source text from the nano Wikipedia page. The cursor is currently located at the beginning of the file, but you can navigate within the text using the arrow keys, page up and down keys, or ‘home’ and ‘end’ keys. Any text you type is entered at the cursor. You can also delete text using the Delete and Backspace keys. Pressing Enter starts a new line. At the bottom of the nano window there is a list of commands that you can use in the editor. To access the commands, simultaneously press ‘control’ and the letter for the command. For example, to Get Help, press the ‘control’ and ‘G’ keys. Let’s see how to use a few of the editing options. To search for a text string, you can press ‘control W’ to use the ‘Where Is’ option. This opens a new pane at the bottom of the app window. Here’s a closer view of that new pane. Within the square brackets you can see the most recently searched string, which here is 1999. Type the string you want to find, for example ‘https’, and press Enter. The cursor moves to the first instance of the search string it finds after the current position of the cursor, here. Nano supports many other editing features which you will explore in one of the labs for this course. Vim is a traditional and very powerful command-line editor. It takes some time to get accustomed to how it works, but with some practice your fingers will develop the muscle memory to accomplish all of your text editing tasks at speed. Entering vim at the command prompt opens the vim app You can also specify a filename to edit a new or existing file. Vim has two basic modes: Insert mode, where you enter text, and Command mode, where you do everything else. After you start a vim session, press i to enter Insert mode. Type some text, for example “some text,” and press the Escape key to exit Insert mode and switch to Command mode. And the text is written to the buffer at the current cursor location. Now you are back in Command mode, and you can save your file with a filename using the ‘colon save’ command along with a filename, such as ‘example dot txt’. The buffer is written to the file and a message is displayed, showing the filename, that it is a new file, it has one line with 10 columns, and that it was successfully written. Now that your file already exists, you can use the more common ‘colon w’ command to write any changes to the file. To quit your vim session, enter ‘colon q’. And to quit and discard any changes made since the last write operation, include the ‘bang,’ or exclamation mark, as in ‘colon q bang’. This was a very short introduction to vim. There are many commands that you can use to navigate the text buffer and perform operations such as searching, copying, pasting, and moving text around. You’ll get to practice some of these commands in an upcoming lab. In this video, you learned that: You can use a variety of command-line or GUI-based text editors to work with your Linux code. gedit is a GUI-based editor that provides many features to simplify your work. GNU nano is a command-line editor that provides similar functionality in a command-line format. And vim is another command-line editor that uses Insert mode to enter data and Command mode to work with the file. So, you’ve seen how to use a text editor to work with existing files. This will be helpful as you learn how to use Linux commands to create files and append text to them.

Describe packages and package managers Differentiate between packages for deb- and RPM-based distros Use a package manager to install updates And use a package manager to install software. Both software updates and software installation files for Linux operating systems are distributed in files known as packages. These packages are archive files containing the required components for either installing new software or updating existing software. You use package managers to manage the download and installation of packages. Different Linux distros provide different package managers—some are GUI-based and some are command line tools. Deb and RPM packages are used by package managers in Linux operating systems. They are distinct file types containing software or updates for different Linux operating systems.
Play video starting at :1:14 and follow transcript1:14
.deb files are used for Debian-based distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Mint. Deb stands for Debian. And .rpm files are used for Red Hat-based distributions such as CentOS/RHEL, Fedora, and openSUSE. RPM stands for Red Hat Package Manager. Deb and RPM formats are equivalent, so the contents of the file can be used on other types of Linux OSs. If you find that a package that you want to use is only available in the other format you can convert it using the alien tool. To convert packages from RPM format to deb, simply use the alien command and specify the package name that you want to convert. To convert to RPM format, use the –r switch with the alien command. Package managers provide several benefits: They can automatically resolve dependencies between packages They can notify you when updates are available GUI-based package managers can automatically check for security and software updates on a regular basis And they can automatically install updates or let you select and install just the ones you want. GUI-based Linux distro package managers include PackageKit and Update Manager. Update Manager is a GUI tool for updating deb-based Linux systems. By default, Update Manager checks for software updates daily, and automatically downloads and installs any security updates daily. All other updates are displayed weekly. You can also manually check for updates at any time. Update Manager will notify you when software updates are available: Select the updates you want to install Click ‘Install Updates’ If prompted, enter your user password, and click OK. And Update Manager installs the updates in the background while you continue working. apt is a command-line tool for updating deb-based Linux systems. You use the “sudo apt update” command to find available packages for your distro. The output of this command lists each available package, builds a dependency tree, and lets you know how many packages can be upgraded. To upgrade all installed packages on a system, use the “sudo apt upgrade” command. If you want to only install a specific package, you can use “sudo apt install package_name” PackageKit is a GUI tool for updating RPM-based Linux systems. When updates are available, PackageKit displays a starburst icon in the notification area. It automatically checks for updates at a configurable interval, and you can also manually check for them at any time. Clicking the starburst icon opens the Software Update window, which lists all available software updates: Select the updates you want to install and then click Install Updates. If requested, enter your user password, and click OK And PackageKit installs the updates in the background while you continue working. yum is a command-line tool for updating RPM-based systems. yum stands for Yellowdog Updater, Modified. To update all packages in your system, type "sudo yum update" After you enter your password, Yum fetches all available package updates. And then it displays a summary of the updates and asks you to confirm the download. If confirmed, yum downloads all the package updates, and updates the packages on your system. And when finished, it displays the success message "Complete!" You can also use command line tools to install new software. Use the apt command with the install switch to install a package on a deb-based system. And use the yum command with the install switch to install software on an RPM-based system. Many software applications use package managers, such as the popular pip or conda packages, for managing Python environments. For example, assuming you already have a Python environment and the relevant pip package, you can easily install the popular “pandas” library used for data wrangling in Python. Enter “pip install pandas” to instruct the pip package manager to: Search for the latest pandas package, Download the pandas package, Check for dependencies and update as required, And install the pandas package. When the installation is complete, the package manager displays the new software version number.

# **Detailed Notes: Linux Packages and Package Managers**

---

## **1. What Are Packages in Linux?**

A **package** is a file that contains:

- The software application or update
- Metadata (version, dependencies, etc.)
- Installation scripts

Packages are used to **install**, **update**, or **remove** software on Linux systems.

> Common package formats:

- `.deb` – for Debian-based distributions
- `.rpm` – for Red Hat-based distributions

---

## **2. Understanding Package Managers**

### **What Is a Package Manager?**

A tool that automates the process of:

- Downloading packages from repositories
- Installing, updating, configuring, and removing software
- Resolving dependencies automatically

### **Types of Package Managers:**

| Type          | Description                            | Examples                   |

| **File extension**       | `.deb`                      | `.rpm`                         |
| **Conversion possible?** | Yes, using the `alien` tool |

> Example: Convert an RPM to DEB format:

```bash
sudo alien package.rpm
```

Convert a DEB to RPM format:

```bash
sudo alien -r package.deb
```

---

## **4. GUI-Based Package Managers**

### **Update Manager (Debian/Ubuntu)**

- Default GUI tool for `.deb` systems.
- Automatically checks for updates daily.
- Installs security updates automatically.
- Allows manual update checking and selection of specific updates.

### **PackageKit / Software Update (RPM-based Systems)**

- Default GUI tool for `.rpm` systems like Fedora or CentOS.
- Shows a notification icon when updates are available.
- Lets you select and install updates with password authentication.

---

## **5. Command-Line Package Managers**

### **For Debian/Ubuntu (.deb): `apt`**

APT stands for **Advanced Package Tool**.

#### **Common Commands:**

| Task                       | Command                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Update package list        | `sudo apt update`               |
| Upgrade all packages       | `sudo apt upgrade`              |
| Install a specific package | `sudo apt install package_name` |
| Remove a package           | `sudo apt remove package_name`  |
| Search for a package       | `apt search keyword`            |

---

### **For Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora (.rpm): `yum` / `dnf`**

- `yum`: Older but widely used on CentOS/RHEL 7
- `dnf`: Newer version used in Fedora and RHEL 8+

#### **Common Commands (yum/dnf):**

| Task                 | Command                                                            |

| Install a package    | `sudo yum install package_name` or `sudo dnf install package_name` |
| Remove a package     | `sudo yum remove package_name` or `sudo dnf remove package_name`   |
| Search for a package | `yum search keyword` or `dnf search keyword`                       |

---

## **6. Using Package Managers to Install Software**

You can use package managers not only for system-level applications but also for programming languages and development tools.

### **Example: Installing Python Libraries via `pip`**

```bash
pip install pandas
```

This command:

- Searches for the latest version of `pandas`
- Downloads and installs it
- Installs any required dependencies

> Similar tools exist:

- `conda` – for data science environments
- `npm` – for JavaScript/Node.js
- `gem` – for Ruby

Welcome to “Overview of Common Linux Shell Commands.” After watching this video, you will be able to: Define what a shell is. List shell command applications, and Recall common shell commands. A shell is a powerful user interface for Unix-like operating systems. It can interpret commands and run other programs. A shell, which enables access to files, utilities, and applications, is also an interactive language. A shell is also a scripting language. And it can be used to automate tasks. The default shell on Linux systems is usually Bash. Other shells include ‘the Bourne shell, S H,’ ‘the Korn shell,’ K S H, ‘T C shell,’ ‘Z shell,’ and ‘fish’. For this course, we will only use the Bash shell, which stands for ‘bourne again shell.’ To find out what the default is, enter ‘printenv SHELL’ on the command line. This returns the path to the default shell program, which in this case is bash. If your default shell is not Bash, you can always switch to it, simply by entering 'bash' on the command line. We will use the dollar sign to represent the command prompt throughout this course. Outside of this course, you may encounter the ‘greater than’ symbol being used for the same purpose. Applications of shell commands include:​ Getting information​, Navigating and working with files and directories, Printing file and string contents​, File compression and archiving​, Performing network operations, Monitoring performance and status of the system, its components and applications, and Running batch jobs, such as ETL operations. Some common shell commands for getting information include: whoami – which returns the user's username, id – which returns the current user, and group IDs, uname – returns the operating system name, ps – displays running processes and their IDs, top – displays running processes and resource usage including memory, CPU, and IO, df – shows information about mounted file systems, man – fetches the reference manual for any shell command, and date – prints today's date. Some common shell commands for working with files include: cp – copy file, mv – change file name or path, rm – remove file, touch – create empty file, update file timestamp, changemod – change or modify file permissions, wc – get count of lines, words, characters in file, and grep – return lines in file matching pattern. Very common shell commands for navigating and working with directories include: LS – lists the files and directories in the current directory, find – used to find files matching a pattern in the current directory tree, pwd – prints the current, or ‘present working,’ directory, mkdir – makes a new directory, cd – changes the current directory to another directory, and rmdir – removes an entire directory. For printing file contents or strings, common commands include: cat – which prints the entire contents of a file, more – used to print file contents one page at a time, head – for printing just the first ‘N’ lines of a file, tail – for printing the last ‘N’ lines of a file, and the very common echo command – which 'echoes' an input string by printing it. It can also ‘echo’ the value of a variable. Shell commands related to file compression and archiving applications include: tar – which is used to archive a set of files, zip – which compresses a set of files, and unzip – which extracts files from a compressed or zipped archive. Networking applications include the following: hostname – prints the host name, ping – sends packets to a URL and prints the response, ifconfig – displays or configures network interfaces on the system, curl – displays the contents of a file located at a URL, and the wget command can be used to download a file from a URL. We should mention that if you happen to be running a Windows machine, and you want to run Linux on it, you can do so in various ways.​ Linux can be installed on a separate drive partition. Switching between the two operating systems requires a reboot. Alternatively, you can install Linux on a virtual machine, or you can install a Linux emulator such as CygWin, or use the Windows Subsystem for Linux, a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows. In this video, you learned that: A shell is an interactive user interface for running commands, a scripting language, and an interactive language. Shell commands are used for navigating and working with files and directories. Shell commands can be used for file compression. The curl and wget commands, respectively, can be used to display and download files from URLs. The echo command prints string or variable values. The cat and tail commands are used to display file contents.

# **Detailed Notes: Overview of Common Linux Shell Commands**

---

## **1. What is a Shell?**

### **Definition**

A **shell** is a powerful **command-line interpreter** used in Unix-like operating systems (like Linux and macOS).

- It acts as both:
  - An **interactive command language** for users to interact with the OS.
  - A **scripting language** for automating tasks.

### **Common Shells in Linux**

| Shell                  | Description                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bash** (`/bin/bash`) | Bourne Again SHell – Default on most Linux distros |
| **sh**                 | Original Bourne shell                              |
| **ksh**                | KornShell – Enhanced version of sh                 |
| **tcsh**               | Extended C Shell with advanced features            |
| **zsh**                | Z Shell – Modern, feature-rich                     |
| **fish**               | Friendly Interactive SHell – beginner-friendly     |

> In this course, we will use **Bash**, the default shell on most Linux systems.

### **How to Check Your Current Shell**

```bash
printenv SHELL
```

Example output:

```
/bin/bash
```

If not Bash, you can switch by typing:

```bash
bash
```

### USER

Welcome to Informational Commands. After watching this video, you will be able to: Find user and operating system information. View system disk usage. Monitor running processes and their resource usage. Print strings, variables, and dates Display manuals for commands
Play video starting at ::30 and follow transcript0:30
You can use informational commands in your terminal to display user information about your system. ​ User info commands are useful when you need to verify the identity of the current user or determine which user account is running a particular command or process. For example, the command “whoami” displays the current user’s username. The “whoami” command takes no arguments and has no options. Here you see a usage example for someone logged in as user “John Doe.” Similarly, the “id” command returns the user or group ID, which is a number assigned to each user or group in the Linux system. In this example, using “id” with the “minus u” option returns the numerical ID of the user. If you would like the name corresponding to the numerical user ID, add the “minus n” option.
Play video starting at :1:26 and follow transcript1:26
The “uname” command, which stands for “Unix name”, returns OS information such as the kernel name and version number. This can be used to identify the type of system you are working on or diagnose system-related issues. Entering the uname command returns the name of the operating system, which in this case is Darwin. Including the “minus s” and “minus r” options returns both the OS name and its version. You can also view more detailed version information using the “minus v” option. You can use the “df”, or “disk free” command to display your system’s disk usage. It can be useful in situations where you need to monitor disk usage or check the available space on a particular file system. For example, entering “df minus h tilde”, displays the following table, which is specific to your home directory, represented by the tilde symbol. In this table, you can see all the disks mounted on your home directory. In Linux, you can “mount” a disk onto a directory, which means that the file system of that disk becomes accessible through that directory. The table also displays the percentage of storage used on each disk. The “minus h” option makes the output “human readable, expressing disk space in units like Gigabytes and Terabytes instead of Bytes.
Play video starting at :2:53 and follow transcript2:53
To view disk usage on all filesystems, you can simply type “df minus h” without specifying a directory. The output includes the size, capacity used, and available space for each filesystem. To see the currently running processes on your system, you can use the “ps”, or “process status” command. This is helpful when you need to monitor or manage processes. Using “ps” with the “minus e” option will list all processes running on the system, regardless of which user started them. The “ps” command displays information such as the name of each running process, the process ID, and the time in minutes and seconds that each process has been running.
Play video starting at :3:39 and follow transcript3:39
The “top”, or “table of processes” command acts as a task manager and will show a table running processes and their resource usage. This command comes in handy when you need to monitor system performance or identify resource-heavy processes. Here we show a usage example with the “minus n” option and the number “3” to display the top three running tasks: Chrome, top, and Spotify. By default, tasks are sorted by CPU usage. This is a simplified output of the “top” command for this video, but “top” provides many other details such as memory usage and the executable file location.
Play video starting at :4:20 and follow transcript4:20
Although simple, the "echo" command in Linux is a powerful tool to display text or variables on the terminal or in a shell script. Entering just “echo” is similar to telling the terminal to print nothing, and it will return a newline. If you would like to echo a single word such as “hello”, you can simply type “echo hello”, and the terminal will return the word. Strictly speaking, you don't need to add quotes around a string with spaces for echo to work as expected, but it's considered best practice to include quotes. Using echo with a quoted string returns the quoted contents, “Learning Linux is fun!" Additionally, you can view the value of a variable, such as our system’s “PATH” variable, by typing a dollar sign followed by the variable name. This can be helpful when troubleshooting or scripting. Here you can see each path of your system’s PATH variable, delimited by colons. Another helpful command is “date,” which displays the current system date and time. Entering “date” returns the default date format: the day of the week, the day, month, year, time, and the time zone. You can also extract certain parts of the date to print, like in this example. To format the output, encapsulate within quotes a combination of text and control characters preceded by a “plus” sign. Format controls are indicated with the % symbol. In this case, “percent j” and “percent Y” output the numerical day of the year and the year itself, respectively. This command prints “97”, for the 97thth day of the year, the words “day of”, and the year, “2023”. Notice how “percent Y” is replaced by the year 2023. Finally, here is another example to show how you can further combine format controls with text to print unique strings. By bringing together controls like “percent A”, “percent j,” and “percent Y” with text, you can print a line that tells you the day of the week, the day, and the year.
Play video starting at :6:33 and follow transcript6:33
This video has only covered the basics of these commands. If you want to learn more about how to use a command, you can use the “man”, or “manual,” command. All default Linux commands come with a manual that you can display using “man.” For example, entering “man ID” will display the manual for the “ID” command. The manual will provide a basic summary of what the command does, such as “return user identity”. Also listed are the options for the “ID” command, such as “minus a.” Square brackets indicate optional parameters, such as “user,” which allows you to specify a username. The “man” command also provides a more detailed description of the command, which explains it in greater detail. The “man” command even has its own “man” page—you can use it to learn more about the manual command and its uses. In this video, you learned how to: Get user information with the "whoami" and "id" commands, Get operating system information using the “uname” command, Check system disk usage using the "df" command, Monitor processes and resource usage with “ps" and "top", Print string or variable value using "echo", Print and extract information about the date with the “date" command, And read the manual for any command using “man”.

### USER

Welcome to “File and Directory Navigation Commands.” In this video, you will learn how to: Use the “list” command to list a directory’s contents Navigate between different directories with the “change directory” command Explain relative and absolute paths, and Find files with the “find” command The ls or “list” command will list the files and directories within a directory. If you enter “ls” in your home directory, you will see all the files and directories that your home directory contains. You can also pass a directory name, such as “Downloads,” as a parameter to ls, which will list the contents of your Downloads folder. The ls command also supports options that will list additional information. Suppose you’re currently working in your documents folder, and you want more information about the files within the directory. You can use the ls command with the -l option, which will show child files and directories in a longer, more detailed format. You can see that the terminal has listed all the child files, directories, and additional details, such as permissions, last-modified date, and owner. At times, you may need to know which directory you’re currently working in. In these cases, you can use the “print working directory” command to get your current working directory. Enter "pwd" into the command line to use the command. Here you can see that you’re currently working in your home directory, “/Users/me.” If you want to change your current working directory, you can use the “change directory” command. The “change directory,” or cd command, is used to change the directory you are working in. Suppose you’re in your home directory and wish to move to a subdirectory within it, such as the Documents folder. Simply enter “cd Documents” to change your working directory. Now, if you enter “pwd,” you can see that you’re now working in your Documents subdirectory. The cd command enables you to change directories with either a relative or an absolute path. Let’s say you’re in a “Notes” folder within your “Documents” directory tree. To get to the parent directory relative to your current folder, enter the cd command with the relative path symbol “..” as its argument. Now your working directory is “Math,” the immediate parent directory of your “Notes” folder. If you want to navigate directly to your home folder, use the tilde symbol with the cd command. This will take you to your home folder. In this case, the tilde symbol represents an absolute path to home. Finally, you can also provide a full path to a directory. Here you are referring to the absolute pathname for the original “Notes” directory. As expected, this command will take you back to the “Notes” folder where you started. Lastly, the “find” command is a powerful tool that will return the path to every file that matches a user-specified criterion. Suppose your “Documents” folder has a file structure as shown, two subfolders, each containing a few files. Let’s say you’re working in your “Documents” folder and want to find the paths of all files named “a.txt” within your working directory. To do so, type “find . -name ‘a.txt’.” The “.” argument means “search within here,” so the command will only search within your current working directory. To perform a case-insensitive version of your search, you can use the “-iname” option instead. You’ll see that you find the same file, plus another file with the same name but with an uppercase “A.” In this video, you learned that: The ls command lists all files and directories contained within a specified directory tree The cd command is used to navigate between directories Relative paths are relative to your current working directory, while absolute paths stand independently The find command is used to find files in your directories

| `find <path> -type f`             | Find files only                          | `find . -type f`                   |
| `find <path> -mtime +n`           | Find files modified more than n days ago | `find /tmp -mtime +7`              |

## 🧠 Understanding Paths

### ✅ **Absolute Path**

- Starts from root (`/`)
- Always begins with `/`
- Example: `/home/user/Documents/report.txt`

### ✅ **Relative Path**

- Based on current working directory
- Uses `.` for current dir, `..` for parent
- Example:
  - If in `/home/user`, then `Documents/report.txt` is relative
  - `cd ../..` moves two levels up

---

### USER

make a details note from this caption of videos [ Welcome to “File and Directory Navigation Commands.” In this video, you will learn how to: Use the “list” command to list a directory’s contents Navigate between different directories with the “change directory” command Explain relative and absolute paths, and Find files with the “find” command The ls or “list” command will list the files and directories within a directory. If you enter “ls” in your home directory, you will see all the files and directories that your home directory contains. You can also pass a directory name, such as “Downloads,” as a parameter to ls, which will list the contents of your Downloads folder. The ls command also supports options that will list additional information. Suppose you’re currently working in your documents folder, and you want more information about the files within the directory. You can use the ls command with the -l option, which will show child files and directories in a longer, more detailed format. You can see that the terminal has listed all the child files, directories, and additional details, such as permissions, last-modified date, and owner. At times, you may need to know which directory you’re currently working in. In these cases, you can use the “print working directory” command to get your current working directory. Enter "pwd" into the command line to use the command. Here you can see that you’re currently working in your home directory, “/Users/me.” If you want to change your current working directory, you can use the “change directory” command. The “change directory,” or cd command, is used to change the directory you are working in. Suppose you’re in your home directory and wish to move to a subdirectory within it, such as the Documents folder. Simply enter “cd Documents” to change your working directory. Now, if you enter “pwd,” you can see that you’re now working in your Documents subdirectory. The cd command enables you to change directories with either a relative or an absolute path. Let’s say you’re in a “Notes” folder within your “Documents” directory tree. To get to the parent directory relative to your current folder, enter the cd command with the relative path symbol “..” as its argument. Now your working directory is “Math,” the immediate parent directory of your “Notes” folder. If you want to navigate directly to your home folder, use the tilde symbol with the cd command. This will take you to your home folder. In this case, the tilde symbol represents an absolute path to home. Finally, you can also provide a full path to a directory. Here you are referring to the absolute pathname for the original “Notes” directory. As expected, this command will take you back to the “Notes” folder where you started. Lastly, the “find” command is a powerful tool that will return the path to every file that matches a user-specified criterion. Suppose your “Documents” folder has a file structure as shown, two subfolders, each containing a few files. Let’s say you’re working in your “Documents” folder and want to find the paths of all files named “a.txt” within your working directory. To do so, type “find . -name ‘a.txt’.” The “.” argument means “search within here,” so the command will only search within your current working directory. To perform a case-insensitive version of your search, you can use the “-iname” option instead. You’ll see that you find the same file, plus another file with the same name but with an uppercase “A.” In this video, you learned that: The ls command lists all files and directories contained within a specified directory tree The cd command is used to navigate between directories Relative paths are relative to your current working directory, while absolute paths stand independently The find command is used to find files in your directories]

# **Detailed Notes: File and Directory Navigation Commands in Linux**

---

## **Introduction**

This video introduces the essential **Linux commands for navigating files and directories**. After watching, you will be able to:

✅ Use `ls` to list directory contents  
✅ Navigate between directories using `cd`  
✅ Understand **relative vs absolute paths**  
✅ Search for files using the `find` command

---

## **1. List Files and Directories: `ls` Command**

### **Purpose**

The `ls` (list) command is used to display the contents of a directory.

### **Basic Usage**

- To list files in the current directory:
  ```bash
  ls
  ```
````

- To list files in a specific directory:
  ```bash
  ls Downloads
  ```

### **Common Options**

| Option | Description                                                  | Example  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `-l`   | Long format – shows permissions, owner, size, date, and name | `ls -l`  |
| `-a`   | Show hidden files (files starting with `.`)                  | `ls -a`  |
| `-la`  | Detailed list including hidden files                         | `ls -la` |

> The output from `ls -l` includes:

- File type and permissions (`drwxr-xr-x`)
- Number of links
- Owner name
- Group name
- Size in bytes
- Date of last modification
- File or directory name

---

## **2. Show Current Working Directory: `pwd`**

### **Purpose**

The `pwd` (print working directory) command shows your **current location** in the file system.

### **Usage**

```bash
pwd
```

> Example Output:

```
/home/user/Documents
```

Useful when:

- You're unsure which directory you are in.
- You want to verify your location before running commands.

---

## **3. Change Directory: `cd` Command**

### **Purpose**

The `cd` (change directory) command lets you move between directories.

### **Basic Syntax**

```bash
cd <directory_path>
```

### **Examples**

| Command                         | Description                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `cd Documents`                  | Move into the `Documents` subdirectory    |
| `cd ..`                         | Move up one level to the parent directory |
| `cd ~` or just `cd`             | Go to your home directory                 |
| `cd /home/user/Documents/Notes` | Move to an absolute path                  |
| `cd ./projects`                 | Move to a relative path                   |

### **Understanding Path Types**

| Type              | Description                                  | Example              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Absolute Path** | Starts from root `/`, always starts with `/` | `/var/log/syslog`    |
| **Relative Path** | Relative to current working directory        | `../images/logo.png` |

---

## **4. Find Files: `find` Command**

### **Purpose**

The `find` command helps you locate files and directories based on various criteria like name, type, size, etc.

### **Basic Syntax**

```bash
find <starting_directory> <options>
```

### **Common Examples**

| Command                         | Description                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `find . -name "a.txt"`          | Find all files named `a.txt` in current directory (`.`) |
| `find /home/user -name "*.txt"` | Find all `.txt` files in user's home directory          |
| `find . -iname "a.txt"`         | Case-insensitive search for `a.txt`                     |
| `find . -type d -name "Images"` | Find directories named `Images`                         |
| `find . -type f`                | Find only files in current directory tree               |

> Tip: The `.` means “start searching here” — it’s useful when you want to limit the scope of your search.

---

## **5. Summary of Key Concepts**

### ✅ `ls` – Listing Contents

- Lists files and directories.
- Use options like `-l`, `-a`, and `-la` for more detailed views.

### ✅ `pwd` – Knowing Where You Are

- Displays the full path of the current working directory.

### ✅ `cd` – Moving Around

- Supports both **absolute** and **relative** paths.
- Use `~` to go to your home directory.
- Use `..` to move up one level.

### ✅ `find` – Searching Efficiently

- Powerful tool for locating files and folders.
- Can use exact names, wildcards, case-insensitive searches, and filters by type.

Welcome to “File and Directory Management Commands.” After watching this video, you will be able to: Create and delete files and directories Explore how to copy and move files and directories Explore how to manage file permissions to make them executable. The make directory command is used to create directories. Let’s say you are in your documents folder, which is currently empty. To create a folder called “test”, you simply enter “mkdir test.” Now your current directory has a subfolder called “test”. The rm command allows you to remove a file or directory. Suppose you have a file structure as shown on the left. And, let’s say you are in the documents folder, and you wish to remove “file1”. You can do this by simply typing “rm file1”. Now you can see only “folder1” is left. You cannot simply remove “folder1” since it may contain other files. However, you can easily get around this by entering “rm” with the -r option. The -r option means you want to remove the directory along with all its child file objects. Your Documents folder is now empty. Accordingly, you should always be careful when using rm with the -r option. It is very easy to accidentally remove folders with important data. Now, suppose you create an empty directory with the mkdir command and then you decide to remove it. The rm option rf command is not recommended. Instead you should use the rmdir command which is used solely to remove empty directories. This guarantees that you’ll never accidentally delete any important files or directories. Entering “ls” shows that the current directory is indeed empty. The touch command can be used to create empty files. Suppose you are in your Documents folder, which is empty, and you wish to create some empty text files. You can do this by entering “touch” along with some filenames: “a”, “b”, “c”, and “d” with the “.txt“ suffix. Now, you can see that your Documents folder contains the four files you created. You might be wondering what the touch command does to an existing file. Suppose your current directory contains a file called “notes.txt". You can see when it was last modified using 'date -r notes.txt’. If you use the touch command on notes.txt, you can see that its last-modified date updated to the current time. The cp command allows you to copy a file or directory. To copy files, you can either: copy a file from a source directory and specify the filename for the file in its destination directory, or simply omit the destination filename and default to keeping the same file name. To copy entire directories, you need to give cp the -r option so that it knows to recursively copy all subdirectories and files. Let’s look at some examples: Suppose you have a file called “notes.txt” and a folder called “Documents” in your working directory. You can copy notes.txt to your “Documents” folder using “cp notes.txt Documents”. Now you can see that your Documents folder contains a copy of notes.txt. Notice that you didn’t need to specify a source directory, because cp defaults to your current directory. Next, you can create a copy of your Documents folder, called “Docs_copy”, using the syntax from the left. And as expected, you now have a “Docs_copy ” folder containing the same contents as the original Documents folder. The mv command allows you to move a file or directory. To move files, you can enter “mv” followed by the paths of the files you want to move, followed by the folder you want to move them to. Likewise, to move directories, you type “mv” with the directory’s path to be moved, followed by the path and directory you want to move them to. Let’s look at an example: Suppose you have a file called “my_script.sh” and three folders, called “Scripts”, ”Notes”, and “Documents”. You can move “my_script.sh” to your “Scripts” folder using the syntax from the left. Accordingly, entering “ls my_script.sh” returns nothing, but, entering “ls Scripts” shows that you successfully moved my_script.sh to your Scripts folder. Next, you can move your Notes and Scripts folders to your Documents folder using the syntax on the left. You can see that your directory now just contains your Documents folder and that your Documents folder contains the Scripts and Notes folders that you just moved. chmod stands for “change mode” and is used to change read, write, and execute permissions on files. Suppose you have a shell script file in your current directory called “my_script.sh” that echoes “Learning Linux is fun!“ Entering ls -l my_script.sh shows that your shell script has read and write permissions, as indicated by the r and w characters. But if you try to execute the file, you get a permission denied error. In order to make your script executable, you call chmod on my_script.sh with the +x option. Entering ls -l my_script.sh now shows that my_script.sh has executable permissions, as indicated by the x character. Great! Running the script now works. In this video, you learned that: You can use the touch command to create a new file or update the last-modified date of an existing file. You can create a directory with the mkdir command, and delete an empty directory with the rmdir command. You can use the cp and mv commands to copy, move, and rename files and directories, and You can use chmod to change read, write and execute permissions on files.

# **Detailed Notes: File and Directory Management Commands in Linux**

---

## **1. Introduction**

This video covers the core **file and directory management commands** in Linux, including:

✅ Creating and deleting files and directories  
✅ Copying and moving files and folders  
✅ Managing file permissions (e.g., making a script executable)

These commands are essential for managing your system, organizing data, and working with scripts or configuration files.

---

## **2. Creating and Removing Files and Directories**

### **A. `mkdir` – Make Directory**

- **Purpose**: Create new directories.
- **Syntax**:
  ```bash
  mkdir <directory_name>
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  mkdir test
  ```

> Creates a directory named `test` in the current location.

---

### **B. `rm` – Remove Files or Directories**

- **Purpose**: Delete files or directories.
- **Syntax**:

  ```bash
  rm <filename>
  ```

- **Remove a file**:

  ```bash
  rm file1.txt
  ```

- **Remove a directory and its contents**:
  ```bash
  rm -r folder1
  ```

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Use `rm -r` carefully — it deletes everything inside the directory recursively.

---

### **C. `rmdir` – Remove Empty Directories**

- **Purpose**: Delete only **empty** directories.
- **Syntax**:

  ```bash
  rmdir <directory_name>
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  rmdir empty_folder
  ```

> If the folder contains files or subdirectories, this command will fail — use `rm -r` instead.

---

### **D. `touch` – Create Empty Files or Update Timestamps**

- **Purpose**: Create an empty file or update the last-modified timestamp of an existing one.
- **Syntax**:

  ```bash
  touch <filename>
  ```

- **Create multiple files**:

  ```bash
  touch a.txt b.txt c.txt
  ```

- **Update timestamp on an existing file**:
  ```bash
  touch notes.txt
  ```

> Useful for testing, scripting, or resetting file timestamps.

---

## **3. Copying and Moving Files and Directories**

### **A. `cp` – Copy Files or Directories**

- **Purpose**: Copy files from one location to another.
- **Syntax**:

  ```bash
  cp <source> <destination>
  ```

- **Copy a single file**:

  ```bash
  cp notes.txt Documents/
  ```

- **Copy and rename a file**:

  ```bash
  cp notes.txt Documents/backup_notes.txt
  ```

- **Copy a directory and all contents**:
  ```bash
  cp -r Documents Docs_copy
  ```

> The `-r` option enables recursive copying of directories and their contents.

---

### **B. `mv` – Move or Rename Files/Directories**

- **Purpose**: Move files/dirs or rename them.
- **Syntax**:

  ```bash
  mv <source> <destination>
  ```

- **Move a file into a directory**:

  ```bash
  mv my_script.sh Scripts/
  ```

- **Rename a file**:

  ```bash
  mv old_name.txt new_name.txt
  ```

- **Move multiple directories into another**:
  ```bash
  mv Scripts Notes Documents/
  ```

> Unlike `cp`, `mv` does **not duplicate** the original — it moves or renames.

---

## **4. Managing File Permissions with `chmod`**

### **A. `chmod` – Change File Mode (Permissions)**

- **Purpose**: Set or change **read**, **write**, and **execute** permissions on files.
- **Syntax**:
  ```bash
  chmod [options] <filename>
  ```

### **Common Options**

| Option | Description               |
| ------ | ------------------------- |
| `+r`   | Add read permission       |
| `+w`   | Add write permission      |
| `+x`   | Add execute permission    |
| `-r`   | Remove read permission    |
| `-w`   | Remove write permission   |
| `-x`   | Remove execute permission |

### **Example: Making a Script Executable**

```bash
chmod +x my_script.sh
```

- Before:

  ```bash
  -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 0 Jan 1 12:00 my_script.sh
  ```

- After:
  ```bash
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 user group 0 Jan 1 12:00 my_script.sh
  ```

Now you can run the script:

```bash
./my_script.sh
```

| Change file permissions         | `chmod +x <file>` | Makes a file executable     |

---

## **6. Final Tips**

- Always double-check before using `rm -r` — it's irreversible.
- Use `rmdir` when removing empty directories to avoid accidental deletion.
- `chmod` is essential for running scripts or setting up secure environments.
- Combine these commands with others like `ls`, `cd`, and `find` for powerful file operations.

### USER

Welcome to viewing file content. In this video, you will learn how to apply commands that operate on files to view the contents of a file in useful ways and determine line, word, and character counts. There are several useful commands for viewing file content. To begin with, you can use the cat command to print the entire file to standard output. Suppose your current directory contains a single file called numbers.txt, which you can see by entering the LS command. To print the contents of this file to standard output, you can type cat numbers.txt, which produces the output shown here consisting of the numbers 89 through to 99. You can see that the output takes up the entire terminal window. The file is much longer than the twelve lines you see here. For this reason, you might not always want to use cat to view contents. Thankfully, there are alternative commands for cases such as these. The more command allows you to view a file's content in a page by page format. By entering more numbers.txt, you see the numbers 0-8 on page 1 as shown. By page we just mean the current terminal window. If you expand your terminal window vertically, you also increase the page size. When you click the space bar, you will see the next page which displays the numbers 9-17. Entering Q quits the more program and returns you to the command prompt. You can use the head command to print the first 10 lines of your file. Entering head numbers.txt returns the first 10 lines or the numbers 0-9 as shown. You can specify the number of lines you would like head to return using the -n option. By entering head, -n 3 numbers.txt, you get back the first three lines of numbers.txt as 0, 1, 2. The tail command is used to print the last 10 lines of a file. Entering tail numbers.txt returns the last 10 lines of numbers.txt, namely the numbers from 90-99. Just like with the head command, you can use the -n option to change the number of lines returned by entering tail -n, 3 numbers.txt. You get back the last three lines of numbers.txt 97, 98, and 99. You can use the WC command to count the number of characters, words, or lines in your file. Imagine you have a file called pets.txt. Entering cat pets.txt shows that the file contains the word cat or the word dog on each line. By entering WC pets.txt, you get the result 7 7 28 pets.txt. Which means that your file contains 7 lines, 7 words, and 28 characters. But 7 times 3 is 21 so why does WC see 28 characters? Because it also counts new line characters. You can't see them there, but there are seven new line characters one of which represents end of file. To view only line count, you can use the -l option which returns 7 pets.txt. Similarly to view only word count, you can use the -w option, and to view only character count, you can use the -c option. In this video, you learned how to apply the cat, more, head, and tail commands to view file contents in multiple ways and determine the line, word, and character count of a file using WC.

# **Detailed Notes: Viewing File Content in Linux**

---

## **1. Introduction**

This video introduces essential **Linux commands for viewing and analyzing file content**, including:

✅ Displaying full or partial contents of a file  
✅ Navigating large files page-by-page  
✅ Counting lines, words, and characters

These tools are especially useful when working with log files, scripts, configuration files, and other text-based data.

---

## **2. Commands to View File Contents**

### **A. `cat` – Concatenate and Print Entire File**

- **Purpose**: Print the entire contents of a file to the terminal.

## **3. Command to Analyze File Content: `wc`**

### **A. `wc` – Word Count**

- **Purpose**: Count **lines**, **words**, and **bytes (characters)** in a file.
- **Syntax**:

  ```bash
  wc <filename>
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  wc pets.txt
  ```

> Output:

```
7 7 28 pets.txt
```

- **Meaning**:
  - **7 lines**
  - **7 words**
  - **28 characters** (including newline characters)

> The character count is higher than expected because `wc` counts **newline characters** (`\n`) as well.

---

### **B. Options for Specific Counts**

| Option | Description                                | Example                          |

Welcome to “Useful Commands for Wrangling Text Files.” In this video, you will learn how to apply commands that operate on files to: Create a line-by-line sorted view. Create a view that excludes repeated lines. Extract lines containing a specified pattern. Extract slices and fields from each line. And merge lines from multiple files. The “sort” command sorts the lines of a file alpha-numerically and prints the sorted result to standard output. By entering "sort pets dot text," you get back the alphabetically sorted output, with "cat" repeated five times and "dog" repeated twice. If you enter "sort minus R pets dot text," you get back the lines sorted in the reverse order, with the "dog" lines appearing before the "cat" lines.
Play video starting at :1:2 and follow transcript1:02
If you have repeated lines in your file, you can use the "unique" command to filter out the repeated lines. Recall the contents of ”pets dot text” by entering "cat pets dot text." By entering "unique pets dot txt," you get back "cat,” “dog,” and “cat." Note that the “unique” command only removes duplicated lines if they are consecutive. Thus, the word “cat” appears twice here because “cat” appears before and after the two “dog” lines, interrupting the consecutive sequence. The “grep” command, which stands for “global regular expression print”, returns lines of a file matching a specified pattern, such as a regular expression. Suppose you have a list of famous people's names stored in a file, which you can view by entering "cat people dot text." You can use grep to find all lines in “people dot txt” that contain the consecutive characters “c h.” To do this, you give grep the matching term, “c h,” followed by the filename. The output returns two results, Dennis Ritchie, and Erwin Schrodinger, containing a lower-case match to “c h.” Performing the same operation, but this time with the “minus i” option, returns an extra result, Charles Babbage, which has an upper-case C. The “minus i” option expands the pattern search by making it case-insensitive. You can also use the “cut” command to extract specific sections from each line in your file. Here you see the list of famous names again, such as Alan Turing and Charles Babbage. You can use the cut command to extract the second to ninth characters from every line by entering “cut minus C 2 dash 9 people dot text.” You can see from the output that “Alan Turing” is returned as “Lan Turi.” Let’s look at a more practical example for using cut with text files. Suppose you want to extract only the last name of each person on your list. You know that each line of your list is made up of two fields: the person’s first and last names. A space separates these fields. Here, you’re cutting to extract the second field from each line. Using the “minus d quote space quote” option, you can specify that the field delimiter, or the character that indicates the break between fields, is a space. Then, use the “minus f two” option to return the second field from each line. This will return the last name of each person from the list.
Play video starting at :3:49 and follow transcript3:49
Additionally, you can use the “paste” command to merge lines from multiple files. Imagine you are given the following three text files, all with the same number of lines: a text file called “first dot text” containing a list of people’s first names. a complementary text file called “last dot text,” which contains the last names of the same people, and a third text file, called “Y O B dot text,” which lists each person's year of birth. You can view these files as a table by entering “paste first.txt last.txt yob.txt.” Notice that the three columns are evenly aligned because Paste uses a tab as the default delimiter. Using this table, you can see, for example, that Charles Babbage was born in 1791. You can specify a delimiter other than Tab using the "minus D" option with the “paste” command. For example, you can use a comma as a delimiter by entering “paste minus D" with a comma surrounded by double quotes, together with the "first," "last," and "Y O B" text files. As you can see, this will create a table combining all three files with a comma between each field, such as "Dennis comma Ritchie comma 1941". In this video, you learned how to: View the lines of a file alpha-numerically using sort, Remove repeated lines from your view with unique, Get the lines of a file that match your desired criteria using grep, Extract slices and fields from lines with cut, Merge lines from different files using paste.

## **1. Introduction**

This video introduces powerful **text processing commands** used to manipulate and analyze text files in Linux:

✅ Sorting lines alphabetically  
✅ Removing duplicates  
✅ Searching for patterns  
✅ Extracting parts of lines  
✅ Merging lines from multiple files

These tools are essential for working with log files, CSV data, configuration files, and more.

---

## **2. Sorting File Content: `sort` Command**

### **Purpose**

Sort the lines of a file **alphabetically or numerically**.

### **Basic Syntax**

```bash

```

### **Examples**

- Sort file alphabetically:

  ```bash
  sort pets.txt
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  cat
  cat
  cat
  cat
  cat

  cat
  ```

> Tip: Use `sort -n` for numeric sorting if your file contains numbers.

---

## **3. Removing Duplicate Lines: `uniq` Command**

### **Purpose**

Filter out **consecutive duplicate lines** in a file.

### **Basic Syntax**

```bash
uniq <filename>
```

### **Example**

Given this content in `pets.txt`:

```
cat
dog
dog
cat
```

Running:

```bash
uniq pets.txt
```

Output:

```
cat
dog
cat
```

> Note: `uniq` only removes **duplicates that appear one after another**. To remove all duplicates regardless of position, first use `sort`, then `uniq`:

```bash
sort pets.txt | uniq
```

---

## **4. Searching for Patterns: `grep` Command**

### **Purpose**

Search for lines containing a specific **pattern** (e.g., word, phrase, regular expression).

### **Basic Syntax**

```bash
grep "pattern" <filename>
```

### **Examples**

- Search for lines containing "ch":

  ```bash
  grep "ch" people.txt
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  Dennis Ritchie
  Erwin Schrodinger
  ```

- Case-insensitive search:

  ```bash
  grep -i "ch" people.txt
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  Charles Babbage
  Dennis Ritchie
  Erwin Schrodinger
  ```

> `grep` supports regular expressions for advanced searches:

```bash
grep "^C" people.txt   # Find names starting with 'C'
```

---

## **5. Extracting Parts of Lines: `cut` Command**

### **Purpose**

Extract specific **characters or fields** from each line of a file.

### **Basic Syntax**

```bash
cut [options] <filename>
```

### **A. Character-Based Extraction**

- Extract characters 2 through 9:

  ```bash
  cut -c2-9 people.txt
  ```

  Example Input:

  Alan Turing
  Charles Babbage
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  lan Turin
  harles B
  ```

### **B. Field-Based Extraction**

Use `-d` to define a delimiter and `-f` to select a field.

- Extract last names (second field) from a space-separated file:

  ```bash
  cut -d' ' -f2 people.txt
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  Turing
  Babbage
  ```

> You can also extract multiple fields:

```bash
cut -d',' -f1,3 csvfile.csv
```

---

## **6. Merging Lines from Multiple Files: `paste` Command**

### **Purpose**

Combine lines from multiple files **side by side**, similar to columns in a table.

### **Basic Syntax**

```bash
paste <file1> <file2> <file3>
```

### **Example**

You have three files:

- `first.txt`:

  ```
  Alan
  Charles
  Dennis
  ```

- `last.txt`:

  ```
  Turing
  Babbage
  Ritchie
  ```

- `yob.txt`:
  ```
  1912
  1791
  1941
  ```

### USER

Welcome to “Networking Commands.” After watching this video, you will be able to: Examine your network configuration Evaluate the stability of a URL connection, and Identify and retrieve data from a URL The “host name” command is used to get or set the “host name” and other information which uniquely identifies your computer. Entering the “host name” command without any options returns the host name of your machine. Which in this example is “my Linux machine dot local.” The “dot local” suffix appears in the host name if your machine has “local domains” set. To drop the domain suffix, you can include the “minus S” option. If you use the “minus i” option, hostname will provide the IP address of the hostname. The ifconfig command, which stands for Interface configuration, displays information regarding all your device’s communication devices. If you enter ”if config” with no options. You get a lot of information – including the IP address, MAC addresses, and the hardware specifications of your communication devices. A lot of this information is beyond the scope of this course and would be more useful for system administrators. You can also specify a specific device you want ifconfig to inspect, such as an ethernet adapter called ”eth0”. Entering “ifconfig eeth zero” returns information about your ethernet adapter, such as its internet address, the number of packets received, including counts of errors and dropped packets, the same metrics applied to transmitted packets, and the total amount of data received and transmitted. You can use the “ping” command to test connectivity to a host or IP address. “ping” sends packets known as ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) requests to the server, listens for a response, and prints a result. For example, by entering “ping google dot com,” “ping” returns a line of info for each successful response to an echo request and continues until you abort with “control C.” And after ping aborts, it prints summary statistics for the ping results. For each echo request, ping reports useful information, including The IP address of the given URL,” one four two dot two five one dot four one dot six-eight,” and the total round-trip time in milliseconds. The provided statistics at the end include: how many packets were transmitted and received, the percentage of packets dropped, and the minimum, average, maximum, and standard deviation of the round-trip times in milliseconds. If you would like the ping command to return a set number of ping results, you can use the “minus C” option: Entering “ping minus c five google dot com” returns the five ping results, aborts, and then prints the same statistics it would print without the “minus C” option. The “curl” command is a powerful tool that enables you to transfer data to and from URLs and supports many different protocols. Entering “curl www dot google dot com” returns the entire HTML content of the landing page at www.google.com, using the default “H T T P” protocol. You can see, for example, the path to a “P N G” file for the Google “G” logo. You can render the logo by appending its path to “google dot com” in your browser. You can even get Curl to write the contents of a URL to a local file. This is done using the “minus o” option. For example, you can enter “curl www dot google dot com” together with the ”minus o” option and a file name such as “google dot text.” You can then view the contents of google.txt using the head command and verify that the file contents indeed match the previous output. Similar to Curl, the “w get” command is used to retrieve files located at a URL. wget is like Curl in that it can retrieve a file located at a URL or the HTML code for a web page, but it is more specialized in its protocol support and has recursive downloading capabilities. This is useful when a URL might point to a folder that contains several files. Here you use wget to download a single test file called “I S O underscore eight eight five nine-dash one dot text,” which is hosted by w3.org. wget returns information while it is downloading, such as: “resolving and connecting” to the target server, “HTTP request sent, awaiting a response,” and “saving the file,” which it automatically names for you to the current directory. For reference, here is what your browser shows you when viewing looking at the data located at the URL. It’s a simple text file. By entering “head minus twelve I S O underscore eight eight five nine-dash one dot text,” you see the first twelve lines of the contents of the downloaded file. As expected, the file contains the exact same data that you just saw on the previous slide. In this video, you learned that: The “host name” command is used to get or set the “host name”. The ifconfig command displays information regarding all your device’s communication devices. You can use the “ping” command to test connectivity to a host or IP address. The “curl” command enables you to transfer data to and from URLs. The “w get” command is used to retrieve files located at a URL.

| `wget`                                | Download files from a URL      | `wget http://example.com/file.txt`         |
| `wget -O custom_name.txt url`         | Download and rename file       | `wget -O data.txt http://example.com/data` |

---

## **8. Final Tips**

- Use `hostname` and `ifconfig` to quickly check your **machine's identity and network status**.
- Use `ping` to **test connection stability** to a website or IP address.
- Use `curl` for quick **data transfer** and testing APIs.
- Use `wget` for **downloading files**, especially when working offline or scripting.

---

## **9. Bonus: Modern Alternative to `ifconfig` – `ip` Command**

While `ifconfig` is widely known, it's being replaced by the more powerful `ip` command suite:

| Task                       | `ip` Equivalent            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Show IP addresses          | `ip addr show` or `ip a`   |
| Show routing table         | `ip route show` or `ip r`  |
| Bring up/down an interface | `sudo ip link set eth0 up` |

Welcome to File Archiving and Compression Commands. After watching this video, you will be able to: Distinguish file archiving from file compression, create archived files and unpack them, and apply commands to compress, decompress, and extract files from archives. Archiving and compression are distinct processes, which are usually combined. Archiving is the process of storing information that you don’t use regularly but want to preserve. An “archive file” is a collection of data files and directories that are stored as a single file. Archiving makes the collection more portable and serves as a backup in case of loss or corruption. File compression, on the other hand, involves reducing the size of a file by taking advantage of redundancy in its information content. The main advantages of compression include preserving storage space, speeding up file transfers, and reducing bandwidth loads. Now, suppose you have created a “notes” directory for keeping track of your course materials. You decide it would be a good idea to archive your notes in case you need them in the future. Your “notes” directory tree has the following structure: It contains two subfolders, called “math” and “physics,” each of which contains files called by the same names, “week 1” and “week 2.” Using the LS command with the –R option, you can recursively list all the directories and files in your current directory tree. You can see the correspondence with the graphical representation of the tree, starting with the parent “notes” directory, the math and physics subdirectories, and the week one and week two files within the math and physics folders. You can use the “tar,” or “tape archiver” command to archive and de-archive files and directories. A popular term for an archived tar file is a ”tar ball.” To archive your entire notes directory, including its subdirectories and all files within, enter the command: “tar minus c f,” a name for the archived file, such as “notes dot tar,” followed by the file or directory you wish to archive, which is “notes.” The “c” option means ”create a new archive,” and the “f” flag tells tar to interpret its input from the file rather than from the default, which is standard input. Entering “L S” shows that your current directory now contains the original notes folder as well as the notes.tar archive file. If you would also like your archive to be compressed, you can enter the same command, except now you include the “-z” option, which filters the archive file through a GNU (pr. “geh-noo”) compression program called g-zip. Adding the suffix “dot g z” to the output name, ensures that Windows-based programs, for example, will correctly recognize the file type. Entering “L S” now shows the compressed “notes dot tar dot gz” file that you created. You can check the contents of your archived notes file by calling tar on your "notes" tar ball with the “minus T,” or "list" option. This lists all the files and directories in your tar ball. And as expected, it has the same structure as your original notes folder, with "notes" as the parent directory, "math" and "physics" as subdirectories, and the week 1 and week 2 files at the terminal nodes. You can also unpack, or “de-archive” your archived files using the tar command. You can enter "tar minus x f" followed by the archive file name, "notes dot tar", plus an optional destination name, for example, "notes," which happens to be the default. The "minus x“ option tells tar to extract file and directory objects from the archive. Now if you enter "L S minus R," you can see that the archived notes folder has been de-archived into a parent folder called notes. subfolders called “math” and “physics,” and the four week one and two files you started with. This verifies that the original structure of your "notes" directory is intact. Similarly, you can decompress a "tar dot gz" file and extract the files from it. To unpack and decompress the notes.tar.gz file, you can enter “tar minus x z f” followed by the compressed archive file name, “notes tar dot g z,” and an optional destination folder, “notes.” Again, by entering “L S minus R,” you can see the directories and files have been unpacked as expected. You can use the “zip” command to compress files and directories and package them into a single archive. Notice the order of operations that zip implements. Zip compresses files prior to bundling them, Whereas tar, with the “minus z option,” achieves compression by applying “g zip” on the entire tarball, but only after bundling it. To compress your “notes” directory and package it to a “zip” file, enter “zip notes dot zip notes.” And after entering “L S,” you can see that the notes.zip archive has been created. The “unzip” command, as you might guess, extracts compressed files from a zip archive and decompresses them. To unzip your notes.zip file, simply enter “unzip notes dot zip”. After entering “L S minus R,” You can see that unzip has created your notes folder, and unpacked your directories and your “week one and two” files, as expected. In this video you learned that: The main advantages of file compression include preserving storage space, speeding up file transfers, and reducing bandwidth loads. You can use the “zip” command to compress files and directories and package them into a single archive of compressed files. You can use tar to archive files and directories into a tarball, and optionally apply gzip compression to the tarball file. You can use unzip to unpack and decompress a zipped archive. And finally, you can use tar to decompress and unpack a tar.gz archive.

# **Detailed Notes: File Archiving and Compression Commands in Linux**

---

## **1. Introduction**

This video explains the difference between **file archiving** and **compression**, and introduces key commands for managing archives:

✅ Understand the difference between **archiving** and **compression**  
✅ Create and extract **tarballs** (`.tar` files)  
✅ Compress and decompress using **gzip** and **zip**  
✅ Extract contents from **compressed archives**

These skills are essential for:

- Backing up data
- Transferring large collections of files
- Managing disk space

---

## **2. Key Concepts**

### **A. Archiving**

- **Definition**: Combines multiple files into a **single file** without reducing size.
- **Purpose**: For **portability and backup**.
- **Example Format**: `.tar`

### **B. Compression**

- **Definition**: Reduces file size by removing redundancy.
- **Purpose**: Saves **storage space**, speeds up **transfers**, and reduces **bandwidth usage**.
- **Common Tools**:
  - `gzip` – used with `.tar.gz` or `.tgz`
  - `zip` – used with `.zip`

---

## **3. Using `tar` – Tape ARchiver**

### **Purpose**

Create or extract **archive files** (called **tarballs**) that bundle directories and files.

### **Basic Syntax**

```bash
tar [options] [archive_name.tar] [files_or_directories]
```

### **Common Options**

| Option | Meaning                                             |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `-c`   | Create a new archive                                |
| `-f`   | Specify filename                                    |
| `-t`   | List contents of an archive                         |
| `-x`   | Extract files from archive                          |
| `-z`   | Filter through gzip (for compression/decompression) |

---

### **A. Creating a Tar Archive**

To archive a directory called `notes`:

```bash
tar -cf notes.tar notes/
```

> Creates `notes.tar`, containing all files in the `notes` directory.

---

### **B. Listing Contents of a Tar File**

To view what's inside `notes.tar`:

```bash
tar -tf notes.tar
```

---

### **C. Extracting Files from a Tar Archive**

To extract files:

```bash
tar -xf notes.tar
```

---

### **D. Compressing a Tar Archive with GZIP**

To compress `notes.tar` into a smaller `notes.tar.gz`:

```bash
tar -czf notes.tar.gz notes/
```

> This bundles and compresses the `notes` directory into a single compressed archive.

---

### **E. Extracting a `.tar.gz` File**

To extract both the archive and its compressed contents:

```bash
tar -xzf notes.tar.gz
```

> The `-z` option automatically handles **gzip compression**.

---

## **4. Using `zip` and `unzip`**

### **A. What is `zip`?**

- Combines **compression and archiving** in one step.
- Produces `.zip` files — widely supported across operating systems.

### **Creating a ZIP Archive**

To compress the `notes` folder into `notes.zip`:

```bash
zip -r notes.zip notes/
```

> The `-r` flag ensures **all subdirectories** are included.

---

### **Listing Contents of a ZIP File**

Use `unzip` to list contents:

```bash
unzip -l notes.zip
```

---

### **Extracting a ZIP File**

To extract the contents:

```bash
unzip notes.zip
```

> Automatically recreates the original directory structure.

---

## **5. Summary Table of Archiving & Compression Commands**

| Task                     | Command                           | Description                            |

| Extract zip file         | `unzip archive.zip`               | Uncompress and unpack `.zip`           |

---

## **6. Comparison: `tar` vs `zip`**

| Feature                    | `tar`                                   | `zip`                            |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Primary Use**            | Archiving (with optional compression)   | Archiving + built-in compression |
| **Compression Tool**       | Usually combined with `gzip` (`tar.gz`) | Built-in compression             |
| **Cross-Platform Support** | Limited on Windows                      | Widely supported                 |
| **Recursive by Default**   | Yes                                     | Requires `-r` for folders        |
| **Preserves Permissions**  | Yes (on Unix/Linux)                     | No (on Windows)                  |

---

## **7. Example Directory Structure**

Suppose you have this directory:

```
notes/
├── math/
│   ├── week1.txt
│   └── week2.txt
└── physics/
    ├── week1.txt
    └── week2.txt
```

You can compress it into:

- `notes.tar` (just archived)
- `notes.tar.gz` (archived + compressed)
- `notes.zip` (compressed archive)

And later extract it back to the same structure using the appropriate command.

---

## **8. Final Tips**

- Use `tar` when preserving permissions and working in Linux/Unix environments.
- Use `zip` for cross-platform compatibility (e.g., sharing with Windows users).
- Always double-check your file extensions:
  - `.tar` → just archived
  - `.tar.gz` or `.tgz` → archived + compressed
  - `.zip` → compressed archive
- Combine `tar` with `gzip` for efficient backups.
- Use `unzip` and `tar -tzf` to preview contents before extraction.

### USER

Welcome to Shell Scripting Basics. After watching this video, you will be able to: Outline what a script is. List use cases for scripting. Describe the ‘shebang’ interpreter directive. Create and run a simple ’hello_world’ shell script. A script is a list of commands that can be interpreted and run by a program called scripting language. Commands can be entered interactively at the command line, or listed line by line in a text file. Scripting languages are usually not compiled. They are interpreted at runtime. Scripts are generally slower to run than compiled languages, but they are also much easier and faster to develop. Scripts are widely used to automate processes, such as ETL jobs, file backups and archiving, and general system administration tasks. You can use scripts for nearly any computational task including, application integration, and plug-in and web application development. A shell script is an executable text file in which the first line usually has the form of an interpreter directive. The interpreter directive is also known as a ‘shebang’ directive, and has the following form: 'pound, bang, interpreter' plus an optional argument. Interpreter is an absolute path to an executable program, and the optional argument is a string representing a single argument. Shell scripts are scripts that invoke a shell program. For example: ‘#!/bin/sh’ invokes the Bourne shell or other compatible shell program, from the bin directory. ‘#!/bin/bash’ ‘shebang’ invokes the Bash shell. ‘Shebang’ directives aren't limited to shell programs. For example, you could create a python script with the following directive: ‘#!/usr/bin/env python3’. Here we demonstrate how a shell script can be used to run a program with a simple ‘hello world’ example. From the command prompt, you can create a simple ‘hello world shell script’ as follows: Use the touch command to create an empty text file called ‘hello_world.sh’ The ‘.sh’ extension is a convention used to indicate that the file is a shell script. Now, turn your text file into a bash script by echoing the bash shebang, and appending that echoed text to your file using the ‘double greater than symbol,’ which is the Bash ‘output redirection’ operator used for appending output to file. Finally, use the echo command to print the statement ‘echo Hello World’ and again, redirect that output to your bash script. Before you can run your bash script, you need to make it executable. First, check the current permission settings of your script by using the ‘ls’ command with the ‘-l’ option. The R and W entries indicate that the script is readable and writable, but the lack of an X means it is not executable. The R, W, and X entries apply to three user-based permission groups: the owner, which is you, the group, and all users. You can make it executable for all users by invoking the ‘chmod’ command with the 'plus X' option. Checking the permission settings now shows that your script is executable for all users, due to the ‘X’ entries for all three permission groups. Now you can finally run your bash script by typing ‘./hello_world.sh’ and pressing enter, and the text ‘hello world’ appears on the command line. In this video, you learned that: A shell script is an executable text file that begins with a 'shebang' interpreter directive. A shell script can be used to execute commands as well as run other programs. Scripting languages are not compiled, they are interpreted at run time. Compiled languages may be much faster than scripting languages, but they also require more development time.

# **Detailed Notes: Shell Scripting Basics in Linux**

---

## **1. What is a Script?**

A **script** is a **list of commands** stored in a file that can be executed as a program.

- Unlike compiled programs, scripts are interpreted at runtime.
- They are written in **scripting languages** like:
  - Bash (Bourne Again SHell)
  - Python
  - Perl
  - Ruby

### **Key Characteristics**

| Feature          | Description                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Interpreted      | Not compiled; executed line by line             |
| Easy to write    | Faster development time than compiled languages |
| Slower execution | Compared to compiled code                       |
| Automation power | Used for automating repetitive tasks            |

---

## **2. Common Use Cases for Shell Scripts**

Shell scripting is widely used in system administration and automation:

| Use Case                    | Example                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Automation**              | Backing up files, rotating logs            |
| **ETL Jobs**                | Extracting, transforming, and loading data |
| **System Administration**   | Monitoring services, user management       |
| **Application Integration** | Chaining tools or APIs together            |
| **Web Development**         | Deployment scripts, build processes        |

> Shell scripts help save time and reduce human error by automating routine tasks.

---

## **3. The Shebang Line (`#!`) – Interpreter Directive**

The first line of any shell script should be the **shebang**, also known as the **interpreter directive**.

### **Purpose**

Tells the system which interpreter to use when running the script.

### **Syntax**

```bash
#!/path/to/interpreter [optional_argument]
```

### **Examples**

| Shebang                  | Meaning                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `#!/bin/sh`              | Use the Bourne shell               |
| `#!/bin/bash`            | Use the Bash shell                 |
| `#!/usr/bin/env python3` | Use Python 3 from environment path |
| `#!/usr/bin/perl`        | Run with Perl interpreter          |

> Without a shebang, the script may run using the current shell — which could lead to unexpected behavior.

---

## **4. Creating Your First Shell Script: “Hello World”**

### **Step-by-step Instructions**

#### **Step 1: Create an empty file**

```bash
touch hello_world.sh
```

> `.sh` is a common extension for shell scripts (not required, but good practice).

---

#### **Step 2: Add the shebang and command**

```bash
echo '#!/bin/bash' >> hello_world.sh
echo 'echo "Hello World"' >> hello_world.sh
```

> This creates a script that runs in Bash and prints “Hello World”.

---

#### **Step 3: Make the script executable**

```bash
chmod +x hello_world.sh
```

> Before this, the file was readable and writable, but not executable.

Use `ls -l hello_world.sh` to check permissions:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 0 Jan 1 12:00 hello_world.sh   # Not executable
```

After `chmod +x`:

```
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user group 0 Jan 1 12:00 hello_world.sh   # Now executable
```

---

#### **Step 4: Run the script**

```bash
./hello_world.sh
```

> Output:

```
Hello World
```

---

## **5. Understanding File Permissions**

Linux uses a permission model to control access to files.

### **File Permission Breakdown**

Using `ls -l`, you’ll see something like:

```
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user group 0 Jan 1 12:00 hello_world.sh
```

- `-rwx` → Owner (user) has Read, Write, Execute
- `r-x` → Group has Read and Execute
- `r-x` → Others have Read and Execute

### **Changing Permissions with `chmod`**

```bash
chmod +x filename.sh     # Add execute permission for all users
chmod u+x filename.sh    # Add execute only for owner
chmod go-r filename.sh   # Remove read for group and others
```

---

## **6. Summary of Key Concepts**

| Concept                     | Description                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Script**                  | A text file containing a list of shell commands |
| \*\*Shebang (`#!`)          | Specifies which interpreter to use              |
| **Interpreted Language**    | Runs directly without compiling                 |
| **Scripting Advantages**    | Fast to develop, great for automation           |
| **Scripting Disadvantages** | Slower than compiled languages                  |
| **Making Executable**       | Use `chmod +x` before running                   |
| **Running a Script**        | Use `./filename.sh` after making it executable  |

---

## **7. Quick Reference Table**

| Task                  | Command                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Create a new script   | `touch script.sh`                        |
| Add shebang           | `echo '#!/bin/bash' > script.sh`         |
| Add command           | `echo 'echo "Hello World"' >> script.sh` |
| Make executable       | `chmod +x script.sh`                     |
| Run script            | `./script.sh`                            |
| View file permissions | `ls -l script.sh`                        |

---

## **8. Final Tips**

✅ Always start your shell script with a shebang line (`#!/bin/bash`)  
✅ Use descriptive names for your scripts  
✅ Test small scripts before scaling them up  
✅ Keep scripts simple and modular  
✅ Comment your code to explain what it does  
✅ Use `chmod` to make scripts executable  
✅ Run scripts with `./script.sh` after setting permissions

---

## **9. Bonus: Anatomy of a Simple Bash Script**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is a comment
echo "Welcome to Shell Scripting!"
```

Save this as `welcome.sh`, make it executable, and run it!

[MUSIC] Welcome to filters, pipes and variables. After watching this video, you will be able to describe and use pipes and filters and explain and set shell and environment variables. Filters or shell commands or programs which take their input from standard input normally the keyboard and return their output to standard output, which is normally the terminal. We can think of a filter as a transformer, a program that transforms input data into output data. There are many examples, including wc, cat, more head, sort, grep and so on. The value of filters is that they can be chained together which brings us to the pipe command. The pipe command, denoted by a vertical slash, immensely extends the functionality of shells. It allows you to chain together sequences of filter commands. The use pattern looks like this accordingly, the output of command 1 becomes the input of command 2, and so on. Not surprisingly, pipe is short for pipeline. For example, you can pipe the output of ls to the sort command with the -r option, which results in a reverse sorted list of directory contents. Shell variables are variables that are limited in scope to the shell in which they were created. Accordingly, shells cannot see each other's shell variables. You can invoke the set command to list all variables and their definitions that are visible to the current shell. Because it also lists a lot of subsequent information, you can pipe the output to head in order to show just the first four variable definitions. To define a new shell variable, simply use the equal sign to assign a value to your chosen variable name. Notice that there are no spaces around the equal sign. As an example, let's define a shell variable called Greetings, which stores the string hello. To see the contents of the new variable Greetings, use the dollar sign to access its value, then echo it back. You can display multiple variables as well. Let's define another variable audience with the value world, then echoing both variables back returns Hello World. To clear a variable, use the unset command. For example, unset AUDIENCE deletes the variable AUDIENCE. Environmental variables are just like shell variables, except they have extended scope. They persist in any child processes spawned by the shell in which they originate. You can extend any shell variable to an environment variable by applying the export command to it. For example, export GREETINGS makes Greetings an environment variable. To list all environment variables, use the env command. Let's check whether Greetings was exported as an environment variable by piping the output of env to grep and filtering the results using the pattern GREE. Indeed, Greetings is now an environment variable. In this video, you learned that filters are shell commands. The pipe operator ' | ' allows you to chain filter commands. Shell variables can be assigned values with '=' and listed using set. Environment variables are shell variables with scope extended to all child processes of the shell. [MUSIC]

# **Detailed Notes: Filters, Pipes, and Variables in Linux Shell**

---

## **1. Introduction**

This video introduces three powerful features of the Linux shell:

✅ **Filters** – commands that process input and produce output  
✅ **Pipes (`|`)** – a way to chain filters together  
✅ **Shell & Environment Variables** – for storing and managing values

These tools are essential for building complex command chains and managing configuration in scripts and interactive sessions.

---

## **2. What Are Filters?**

### **Definition**

A **filter** is a command or program that:

- Accepts input from **standard input (stdin)** (e.g., keyboard)
- Processes or transforms the data
- Sends output to **standard output (stdout)** (e.g., terminal)

### **Common Filter Commands**

| Command        | Description                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `wc`           | Count lines, words, characters           |
| `cat`          | Print or concatenate files               |
| `more`, `less` | View content page by page                |
| `head`, `tail` | Show beginning or end of a file          |
| `sort`         | Sort lines alphabetically or numerically |
| `grep`         | Search for patterns in text              |

### **Example of a Filter Chain**

```bash
ls | sort -r
```

> Takes output from `ls` and sorts it in reverse order.

---

## **3. The Pipe Operator (`|`) – Chaining Filters Together**

### **Purpose**

The pipe operator allows you to **connect the output of one command as input to another**, forming a **pipeline**.

### **Syntax**

```bash
command1 | command2 | command3
```

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1: List variables and show only the first few**

```bash
set | head -n 4
```

> `set` lists all shell variables; `head -n 4` shows only the first four lines.

#### **Example 2: List environment variables matching a pattern**

```bash
env | grep GREE
```

> `env` lists all environment variables; `grep GREE` filters for those containing "GREE".

#### **Example 3: Count number of processes**

```bash
ps | wc -l
```

> Counts how many running processes there are.

---

## **4. Shell Variables**

### **What Are Shell Variables?**

Variables defined within a shell session that are **not available to child processes** (like subshells or other programs).

### **Creating a Shell Variable**

```bash
GREETINGS=hello
AUDIENCE=world
```

> ⚠️ No spaces around the `=` sign.

### **Accessing Variable Values**

Use the `$` symbol to access variable contents:

```bash
echo $GREETINGS $AUDIENCE
```

> Output:

```
hello world
```

### **Listing All Shell Variables**

```bash
set
```

> Shows all shell variables and functions visible in the current shell.

### **Removing a Shell Variable**

```bash
unset AUDIENCE
```

> Removes the variable `AUDIENCE`.

---

## **5. Environment Variables**

### **What Are Environment Variables?**

Environment variables are like shell variables but with **global scope** — they are visible to the current shell **and any child processes**.

### **Promoting a Shell Variable to Environment Variable**

```bash
export GREETINGS
```

> Now `GREETINGS` is an environment variable.

### **Listing All Environment Variables**

```bash
env
```

Or filter using `grep`:

```bash
env | grep GREETINGS
```

> Confirms `GREETINGS` is now an environment variable.

---

## **6. Key Differences Between Shell and Environment Variables**

| Feature          | Shell Variable                 | Environment Variable                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Scope            | Only current shell             | Current shell + child processes        |
| Created with     | `VAR=value`                    | `export VAR=value`                     |
| Visibility       | Not visible to child processes | Visible to child processes             |
| Example use case | Temporary storage in script    | Configurable settings for apps/scripts |

---

## **7. Summary Table: Commands for Working with Filters, Pipes, and Variables**

| Task                               | Command      | Description                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Run two commands in sequence       | `cmd1        | cmd2`                                  | Output of `cmd1` becomes input of `cmd2` |
| Count lines in a directory listing | `ls          | wc -l`                                 | Lists files and counts them              |
| View only top 4 shell variables    | `set         | head -n 4`                             | Lists shell vars and shows top 4         |
| Create a shell variable            | `VAR=value`  | No spaces around `=`                   |
| Access variable value              | `echo $VAR`  | Use `$` to get value                   |
| Remove a variable                  | `unset VAR`  | Deletes variable from shell            |
| Make shell var an env var          | `export VAR` | Makes var available to child processes |
| List all environment variables     | `env`        | Shows global variables                 |
| Filter environment variables       | `env         | grep PATTERN`                          | Search for specific variables            |

---

## **8. Full “Hello World” Example Using Variables**

```bash
GREETINGS=hello
AUDIENCE=world
echo $GREETINGS $AUDIENCE
# Output: hello world

unset AUDIENCE
export GREETINGS
env | grep GREETINGS
# Output confirms GREETINGS is now an environment variable
```

---

## **9. Final Tips**

- Use **pipes** to build powerful one-liners.
- Use **filters** to transform and analyze data.
- Use **shell variables** for temporary values inside scripts.
- Use **environment variables** to pass values to sub-processes or configure applications.
- Always check your syntax when assigning variables — no spaces around `=`.
- Combine these tools for automation, analysis, and scripting.

### USER

Welcome to “Useful Features of the Bash Shell.” After watching this video, you will be able to: Outline some key Bash shell-scripting features. Learn about the characters and symbols in Bash shell scripting features. Metacharacters are special characters that have meaning to the shell. The pound symbol is used to include comments that the shell ignores. For example, this comment does not return anything. The semicolon is a metacharacter that separates commands typed on the same line. For example, these two commands return their outputs on two lines like this. The asterisk represents any number of consecutive characters within a filename pattern. For example, this expression returns all objects in the slash bin directory with a name starting with ba and followed by any characters, which in this case is Bash. And the question mark acts as a single-character version of the asterisk metacharacter. For example, this expression lists all objects in the slash bin directory having a single character in place of the question mark, namely the bash and dash paths. Quoting specifies whether the shell should interpret special characters as metacharacters or ‘escape’ them. You can use the backslash to escape the interpretation of a single character as a metacharacter. Here, the backslash tells Bash to interpret the dollar sign as text rather than the default variable name, so the output is literally ‘dollar one each.’ Double quotes will interpret the text literally, except for any metacharacters, which will be interpreted according to their special meanings. For example, the ‘dollar one’ expression, without the preceding backslash, is interpreted as a variable, which in this case is empty, as we see here. Notice that it printed the space before “each.” Single quotes, on the other hand, are used to interpret all contents as literal characters. For example, this expression returns the same result as the first example above. Input/Output, or ‘I’ ‘O’ redirection, refers to a set of features used for redirecting either the standard input, the keyboard, or the standard output, the terminal. The ‘>’ symbol is used to redirect the standard output of a command to a file. It also creates the file if it doesn’t exist and overwrites its contents if it already exists. You can avoid overwriting by using the double greater than symbol, which appends output to existing content. The combination ‘2>’ redirects an error message to a file. To append the error message, for example, to an error log file, add another greater than sign. And lastly, the less than sign is a redirection that is used to pass file contents as input to the standard input. Let’s look at a few examples. You can start by simultaneously creating a file and populating it with some text, like this. You can then cat the file to see what’s there. As you can see, ‘line1’ was written to ‘eg.text’. Now, you can try adding another line to the file. And viewing the contents again, you can see that the file contains exactly the two lines you added. Entering something like the word garbage returns an error. This expression catches the error message and redirects it to the file ‘err.txt.’ And indeed, the contents of ‘err.txt’ is what can be expected. You can use command substitution to replace a command with its output. There are two equivalent notations: in the first, the command is encapsulated by parentheses with a dollar sign out front, while in the second, the command is encapsulated within backticks, also known as backquotes. Let’s say you want to store the current directory path in a variable called ‘here.’ You can use command substitution on the pwd (or present working directory) command to capture its output and assign it to the variable ‘here.’ And indeed, echoing its value returns the current directory. Command line arguments are arguments used by a program specified on the command line. In particular, they provide a way to pass arguments to a shell script, a program. Command line arguments for a Bash script are specified: The arguments ‘arg1’ and ‘arg2’ are passed to ‘MyBashScript.sh’. Bash has two main modes of operation: Batch mode, which is the usual mode, runs commands sequentially. For example, these two commands, separated by the semicolon metacharacter, will be executed in a particular order. Command 2 only runs after command 1 is completed. In concurrent mode, commands run in parallel. The ampersand operator, after command 1, directs command 1 to operate in the background and passes control to command 2 in the foreground. In this video, you learned that: Metacharacters are special characters that have meaning to the shell. Quoting is used to interpret or escape metacharacter meaning. I/O redirection refers to a set of features used for redirecting. Command substitution to replace a command with its output. Command line arguments are used to pass arguments to a shell script. Concurrent mode allows commands to run in parallel.

### ASSISTANT

# **Detailed Notes: Useful Features of the Bash Shell**

---

## **1. Introduction**

This video introduces essential **Bash shell features** that enhance scripting and command-line usage:

✅ **Metacharacters** – special characters with built-in meanings  
✅ **Quoting & Escaping** – control how the shell interprets commands  
✅ **I/O Redirection** – manage input and output streams  
✅ **Command Substitution** – insert results from one command into another  
✅ **Command Line Arguments** – pass values to scripts  
✅ **Running Commands in Batch or Concurrent Mode**

These tools allow for powerful automation, customization, and efficiency.

---

## **2. Metacharacters – Special Characters in Bash**

### **Definition**

Metacharacters are symbols interpreted by the shell to perform specific operations.

| Symbol | Meaning                                     | Example                                             |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `#`    | Comment (ignored by shell)                  | `# This is a comment`                               |
| `;`    | Command separator                           | `echo "Hello"; echo "World"`                        |
| `*`    | Wildcard – matches any number of characters | `ls ba*` → matches `bash`, `bar`, etc.              |
| `?`    | Single-character wildcard                   | `ls b?sh` → matches `bash`, `bosh`, but not `bsssh` |
| `\`    | Escape character                            | `echo \$1` → prints `$1` literally                  |

---

## **3. Quoting – Literal vs Interpreted Text**

### **A. Single Quotes (`'...'`)**

- Treats everything inside as **literal text**
- Ignores variable substitution and metacharacter interpretation

> Example:

```bash
echo '$HOME is /home/user'
```

Output:

```
$HOME is /home/user
```

---

### **B. Double Quotes (`"..."`)**

- Allows some **interpretation**, such as:
  - Variable expansion (`$VAR`)
  - Command substitution (`$(...)` or backticks)

> Example:

```bash
echo "$HOME is my home directory"
```

Output (if `$HOME=/home/user`):

```
/home/user is my home directory
```

---

### **C. Backslash (`\`) – Escaping Metacharacters**

Use backslash to prevent interpretation of special characters.

> Example:

```bash
echo "The cost is \$1 only"
```

Output:

```
The cost is $1 only
```

---

## **4. Input/Output (I/O) Redirection**

Used to redirect standard input, output, and error streams.

| Operator | Description                      | Example                     |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `>`      | Redirect output (overwrite file) | `echo "line1" > eg.txt`     |
| `>>`     | Append output to a file          | `echo "line2" >> eg.txt`    |
| `<`      | Redirect input from a file       | `wc -l < eg.txt`            |
| `2>`     | Redirect standard error          | `somecommand 2> error.log`  |
| `2>>`    | Append standard error            | `somecommand 2>> error.log` |

> Example:

```bash
echo "line1" > eg.txt
echo "line2" >> eg.txt
cat eg.txt
```

Output:

```
line1
line2
```

---

## **5. Command Substitution – Run Command Inside Another**

Allows you to run a command and use its **output as part of another command**.

### **Syntax Options**

| Syntax          | Description             |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `$(command)`    | Preferred modern syntax | `echo "Current dir: $(pwd)"` |
| `` `command` `` | Older backtick syntax   | `echo "Today is `date`" `    |

> Example:

```bash
here=$(pwd)
echo "You are in: $here"
```

Output:

```
You are in: /home/user
```

---

## **6. Command Line Arguments**

When running a script, you can pass **arguments** to it using the command line.

### **Accessing Arguments in Script**

| Notation        | Description                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `$0`            | Name of the script itself     |
| `$1`, `$2`, ... | First, second, etc., argument |
| `$@`            | All arguments as list         |
| `$#`            | Number of arguments passed    |

> Example:

```bash
./myscript.sh arg1 arg2
```

Inside `myscript.sh`:

```bash
echo "Script name: $0"
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Second argument: $2"
echo "All arguments: $@"
echo "Number of arguments: $#"
```

---

## **7. Running Commands Sequentially vs Concurrently**

### **A. Batch Mode – Sequential Execution**

Commands are executed **one after another**.

> Example:

```bash
sleep 2; echo "Done"
```

- `sleep 2` runs first.
- `echo "Done"` runs after it finishes.

---

### **B. Concurrent Mode – Parallel Execution**

Use `&` to run a command **in the background**.

> Example:

```bash
long_process.sh & echo "Continuing..."
```

- `long_process.sh` runs in the background.
- `echo` runs immediately without waiting.

---

## **8. Summary Table**

| Feature                  | Purpose                               | Example                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Metacharacters**       | Perform special actions               | `*`, `?`, `#`, `;`, `\`                                   |
| **Single Quotes**        | Interpret text literally              | `'text'`                                                  |
| **Double Quotes**        | Allow variable/command interpretation | `"text $VAR"`                                             |
| **Backslash**            | Escape special meaning                | `\$`, `\*`                                                |
| **Redirection**          | Control input/output                  | `>` (overwrite), `>>` (append), `<` (input), `2>` (error) |
| **Command Substitution** | Use command output in another command | `$(command)` or `` `command` ``                           |
| **Command Line Args**    | Pass values to scripts                | `script.sh arg1 arg2`                                     |
| **Batch Mode**           | Run commands sequentially             | `cmd1; cmd2`                                              |
| **Concurrent Mode**      | Run commands in parallel              | `cmd1 & cmd2`                                             |

---

## **9. Full Example: Combining Concepts**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is a comment

message="Script started at $(date)"
echo "$message" > log.txt

echo "Writing to log file..." >> log.txt

# Try something that causes an error
ls /invalid_path 2> error.txt

# Print contents of files
cat log.txt
cat error.txt
```

> Output:

```
Script started at [current date]
Writing to log file...
ls: cannot access '/invalid_path': No such file or directory
```

---

## **10. Final Tips**

- Use **metacharacters** to write compact and powerful commands.
- Use **quoting** to control whether variables and wildcards get expanded.
- Use **redirection** to capture outputs or errors into files.
- Use **command substitution** to dynamically insert command results.
- Use **command line arguments** to make your scripts more flexible.
- Use **batch mode** for sequential execution, **concurrent mode** for background tasks.
- Combine these features for efficient and readable shell scripts.

Browsing directories with the Linux terminal
Learning Objectives
After finishing this reading, you will be able to:

Describe what a Linux terminal is used for
Use the pwd and ls commands to browse directories in your Linux file system
The Linux terminal

You can interact with the Linux shell by entering commands into the Linux terminal, which is also commonly referred to as the command line or the command prompt.

In this case, the present working directory is /home/project, as indicated by the blue text. The dollar sign $ following it is called the command prompt.

Recall that a terminal window is a simple user interface that allows you to run any commands that you would like, simply by typing the command on your keyboard and hitting Enter. Many commands will respond by returning some sort of output, which by default appears as text in your terminal window.

Let's see how this works using a couple of the most common Linux commands, the pwd and ls commands:

Here we've entered the pwd command, which prints the path name for our present working directory on the next line. You can see that the command prints what we expected, which is the path to the present working directory, /home/project. Notice also that the command prompt shows up again on the following line, awaiting your next command.

Great! Now, how do you see what's inside your present working directory?

You can use the ls command to list the contents of the directory you are currently working in. At the moment, the /home/project directory is brand new and doesn't contain anything yet, so entering the ls command will return nothing:

Being a conservative program, ls won't bother with printing a blank line to express that there is nothing to list.

Let's see if we can find a directory that already contains content. You can list the contents of any directory with the ls command by specifying the directory name you'd like to explore.

For example, ls /home lists the contents of the /home directory:

You can see that the directory /home contains two objects, namely project and theia.

Tip: Think of a directory as a folder that contains files and subdirectories. In this case, project and theia are subdirectories of /home. Subdirectories can contain additional files and subdirectories. You'll learn more about exploring subdirectories in later labs.

Notice the naming convention for a directory's path: /home/project indicates that the project directory is a subdirectory of /home. The path for the theia subdirectory would similarly be /home/theia.

Like a tree, your Linux file system has a root directory (/, called "slash") from which your entire Linux file system branches out.

One important subdirectory of your root directory is home. You can see this for yourself by entering ls / to list the contents of /:

Summary
Congratulations! In this reading, you learned that:

You can interact with the Linux shell by entering commands into the Linux terminal
The pwd command prints the path name to the present working directory
The ls command lists the contents of a directory

### ASSISTANT

# **Browsing Directories with the Linux Terminal**

---

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

✅ Understand what a **Linux terminal** is and how it works  
✅ Use the `pwd` command to display your **current working directory**  
✅ Use the `ls` command to **list contents of a directory**

---

## **1. What Is the Linux Terminal?**

The **Linux terminal**, also known as:

- Command line
- Shell prompt
- Command prompt

It is a **text-based interface** used to interact with the operating system by typing commands.

### **Understanding the Prompt**

You may see something like:

```
/home/project $
```

- `/home/project` – This is the **current working directory**
- `$` – The **command prompt**, where you type commands

> On some systems, you might see `#` instead of `$`. A `#` indicates you're logged in as a **superuser (root)**.

---

## **2. `pwd` – Print Working Directory**

### **Purpose**

Shows the **full path** of the directory you are currently in.

### **Usage**

```bash
pwd
```

### **Example Output**

```
/home/project
```

This means you are in the `project` subdirectory inside the `home` directory.

---

## **3. `ls` – List Directory Contents**

### **Purpose**

Displays files and directories in the current location or specified location.

### **Basic Usage**

```bash
ls
```

If the current directory is empty, the command returns **no output** — not even a blank line.

### **List Contents of a Specific Directory**

You can specify a directory path:

```bash
ls /home
```

### **Example Output**

```
project  theia
```

This shows that the `/home` directory contains two **subdirectories**: `project` and `theia`.

---

## **4. Understanding Filesystem Paths**

Linux uses a **tree-like structure** for organizing files and directories.

### **Root Directory**

- Represented by `/` (called "slash")
- The topmost directory in the filesystem

### **Subdirectories**

- Folders within other folders
- Example: `/home/project` means:
  - `project` is a subdirectory inside `home`
  - `home` is a subdirectory inside the root (`/`)

### **Path Examples**

| Path            | Description                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/`             | Root directory                             |
| `/home`         | Home directory (contains user directories) |
| `/home/project` | User-specific directory for projects       |

---

## **5. Summary of Commands**

| Command    | Description                                     | Example                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `pwd`      | Print Working Directory – show current location | `pwd` → `/home/project` |
| `ls`       | List contents of current directory              | `ls`                    |
| `ls <dir>` | List contents of a specific directory           | `ls /home`              |

---

## **6. Final Notes**

- The **terminal** allows you to interact with your Linux system using text commands.
- Use `pwd` to always know where you are in the file system.
- Use `ls` to explore what’s inside a directory.
- You can navigate through the Linux file system using paths and commands like `cd`, which you'll learn more about in future lessons.

Linux Terminal Tips - Tab completion, command history
Learning Objectives
After completing this reading, you will be able to:

Use tab completion to autocomplete commands
Use command history to quickly navigate previous commands
Tab Completion
Many shells support a feature called tab completion.

Tab completion allows you to autocomplete a command you're typing on the command line.

Suppose you're in your home directory ~, which contains the directories:

Pictures
Videos
Documents
Downloads
And suppose your Documents folder only contains the folder:

python-examples
Tab completion:
In this exercise, you will use tab completion to quickly enter a command to navigate to the Pictures directory.

If you type:

1
~ $ cd P

Copied!
and press Tab, the shell will autocomplete the command to:

1
~ $ cd Pictures/

Copied!
because the Pictures directory is the only directory within your current folder that starts with a "P".

Tab completion for long paths:
You can also use tab completion to autocomplete longer paths.

If you type:

1
~ $ cd Do

Copied!
and press Tab, nothing will happen because your current directory contains more than one directory that starts with "Do". The shell won't know whether to autocomplete with Documents or Downloads.

On the other hand, if you type:

1
~ $ cd Doc

Copied!
and press Tab, the shell will autocomplete to:

1
~ $ cd Documents/

Copied!
because in this case, there's only one directory that starts with "Doc," Documents.

If you press Tab again, the shell will further autocomplete to:

1
~ $ cd Documents/python-examples/

Copied!
because the folder python-examples is the only existing file within the ~/Documents directory. With just a few clicks, you can quickly autocomplete longer paths in your command line.

Command History
Command history allows you to navigate previous commands you've entered using the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys.

Let's say you've created a Python script called myprogram.py in your python-examples directory that simply prints Hello, World! when you run it.
Consider you have just entered the following sequence of commands, and the shell is awaiting your next input:

1
2
3
4
5
~ $ cd ~/Documents/python-examples
~/Documents/python-examples $ python3 myprogram.py
Hello, World!
~/Documents/python-examples $ cd /
/ $

Copied!
In the following exercises, you will learn how to rerun a previous command withut having to retype it by pressing the Up Arrow key.

Running the last command:
If you press the Up Arrow key once, the shell will automatically insert the last command you entered:

1
2
3
4
5
~ $ cd ~/Documents/python-examples
~/Documents/python-examples $ python3 myprogram.py
Hello, World!
~/Documents/python-examples $ cd /
/ $ cd /

Copied!
Notice that the last command you entered was cd /, which has been automatically inserted onto the command line for you.

Running previous command from session:
If you press the Up Arrow key two additional times (so, three times total), the shell will automatically insert the command you ran three commands ago:

1
2
3
4
5
~ $ cd ~/Documents/python-examples
~/Documents/python-examples $ python3 myprogram.py
Hello, World!
~/Documents/python-examples $ cd /
/ $ cd ~/Documents/python-examples

Copied!
In this case, the command you ran three commands ago was cd ~/Documents/python-examples. Note that the line of printed output, Hello, World!, does not count as a command. Command history will only take you through commands you entered, not every line that is visible in the terminal.

Tip: If you click the Up Arrow key too many times, you can use the Down Arrow key to cycle through your command history in the opposite direction.

Press Enter to return to your ~/Documents/python-examples directory. You should see something like the following:

1
2
3
4
5
6
~ $ cd ~/Documents/python-examples
~/Documents/python-examples $ python3 myprogram.py
Hello, World!
~/Documents/python-examples $ cd /
/ $ cd ~/Documents/python-examples
~/Documents/python-examples $

Copied!
Summary
Congratulations! You now know how to use a few convenient shortcuts to speed up your command line interactions!

In this reading, you learned how to:

Use tab completion to autocomplete commands
Use the command history to quickly navigate to previous commands

# **Linux Terminal Tips: Tab Completion & Command History**

---

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

✅ Use **Tab Completion** to speed up command typing  
✅ Use **Command History** to reuse or edit previous commands

These two features help make working in the Linux terminal **faster**, **more efficient**, and **less error-prone**.

---

## **1. Tab Completion – Speed Up Typing Commands**

### **What is Tab Completion?**

A time-saving feature that **auto-fills** partially typed commands, file names, or paths when you press the **Tab key**.

> Works for:

- Commands
- File names
- Directory paths

### **How It Works**

- Type part of a name and press **Tab**
- The shell tries to complete it automatically
- If multiple matches exist, pressing Tab again may show suggestions or do nothing until more characters are entered

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1: Navigate to `Pictures`**

```bash
cd P<TAB>
```

Becomes:

```bash
cd Pictures/
```

Because `Pictures` is the only directory starting with "P".

#### **Example 2: Ambiguous Match (Do → Documents vs Downloads)**

```bash
cd Do<TAB>
```

No auto-complete because both `Documents` and `Downloads` start with "Do".

#### **Example 3: Specific Match (Doc → Documents)**

```bash
cd Doc<TAB>
```

Becomes:

```bash
cd Documents/
```

Only one match found.

#### **Example 4: Long Path Completion**

Inside `~/Documents`:

```bash
cd py<TAB>
```

If there's only one folder named `python-examples`, it becomes:

```bash
cd python-examples/
```

You can keep pressing **Tab** to go deeper into nested directories if they're unambiguous.

---

## **2. Command History – Reuse Previous Commands**

### **What is Command History?**

Linux keeps a **record of all commands** you've entered during your session.

You can navigate this list using:

- **↑ (Up Arrow)** – Go back through older commands
- **↓ (Down Arrow)** – Move forward toward newer commands

This lets you **reuse or modify previous commands** without retyping them.

### **How to Use It**

#### **Scenario: You ran these commands**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/python-examples
python3 myprogram.py
cd /
```

Now, at the prompt:

```bash
/ $
```

#### **Step 1: Press ↑ once**

Repeats the last command:

```bash
cd /
```

#### **Step 2: Press ↑ again**

Repeats:

```bash
python3 myprogram.py
```

#### **Step 3: Press ↑ again**

Repeats:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/python-examples
```

> Tip: If you go too far back, use the **↓ arrow** to move forward through history.

## **3. Summary Table**

| Feature             | Description                                  | Example                                           |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tab Completion**  | Auto-completes commands, filenames, or paths | Type `cd Doc<TAB>` → completes to `cd Documents/` |
| **Command History** | Recalls previously used commands             | Use ↑ and ↓ arrows to scroll through commands     |

---

## **4. Final Tips**

- Use **Tab Completion** to avoid typos and save time.
- Use **Command History** to repeat or tweak earlier actions.
- Combine both features to work faster and smarter in the terminal.

### USER

Exercise 1 - Browsing Directories
ls

In this exercise, you will learn how to browse the content of directories using the ls command.

ls is a special command that the shell interprets and runs as a program.

1.1. Viewing files in the current working directory
Typing and entering ls will display all files and directories contained within your current working directory:

1
ls

Copied!
Your default current working directory in this lab environment, the /home/project directory, is empty. Thus entering ls into the command line will not return anything yet.

1.2. Viewing files and directories within any directory
If you know the path to a directory, you can view its contents by passing the path name as a command line argument to the ls command as follows:

ls [PATH TO DIRECTORY]

For example:

1
ls /

Copied!
will show the contents of 'slash', your Linux system's root directory.

Recall some of the standard subdirectories of 'slash' that you've learned about previously:

Directory Contains
/bin System commands, also called binaries
/sbin System administration binaries
/usr User programs and data
/home Home directory
/media Removable media device directories
For example, entering the following command:

1
ls /bin

Copied!
will display the contents of the /bin directory.

Notice that one of the files in the /bin directory is called "ls". Indeed, when you enter the ls command, Linux searches for and runs the ls command by executing the binary file /bin/ls.

### ASSISTANT

# **Exercise 1 – Browsing Directories with `ls`**

---

## **Objective**

In this exercise, you will learn how to use the `ls` command to:
✅ View files and directories in your current working directory  
✅ Browse contents of other directories using their paths

---

## **1. What is `ls`?**

The `ls` command (**list**) shows the contents of a directory.

- It lists:
  - Files
  - Subdirectories

> The shell interprets `ls` as a program located at `/bin/ls`.

---

## **2. Viewing Contents of Current Directory**

### **Command**

```bash
ls
```

### **What Happens?**

- Lists all visible files and directories in the **current working directory**
- If the directory is empty (like your default `/home/project`), it returns **no output**

> Example:

```bash
/home/project $ ls
[No output]
```
