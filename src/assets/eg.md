Okay, the new screenshot (image_473cad.png) is exactly what we needed! This confirms Netlify's recommended DNS configuration for your domain.

You're right, after clicking "Awaiting External DNS," Netlify gives you the precise instructions for the records you need to create in Cloudflare.

Here's the breakdown of what you need to do in your **Cloudflare DNS settings** for `milantimalsina4.com.np`:

**1. Go to your Cloudflare Dashboard:**
   * Log in to your Cloudflare account.
   * Select your domain `milantimalsina4.com.np`.
   * Go to the **DNS** section (DNS > Records).

**2. Add/Edit the Recommended Record for your Root Domain (`milantimalsina4.com.np`):**

Netlify recommends using an **ALIAS, ANAME, or Flattened CNAME record** if your DNS provider supports it. Cloudflare does support "CNAME Flattening" at the root, which effectively works like an ALIAS/ANAME.

* **Type:** `CNAME`
* **Name:** `@` (or leave it blank, Cloudflare will automatically interpret it as the root domain)
* **Target:** `apex-loadbalancer.netlify.com`
* **Proxy status:** Ensure the cloud icon is **orange (Proxied)**. This is crucial for Cloudflare's performance and security features.
* Click **"Save"**.

**Why the CNAME to `apex-loadbalancer.netlify.com` is better:**
This approach is more robust because `apex-loadbalancer.netlify.com` is a dynamic target that Netlify manages. If Netlify changes the underlying IP address of their load balancer, your domain will automatically resolve to the new IP without you needing to update your DNS records.

**3. Ensure Your `www` CNAME Record is Correct (if you haven't already):**

You also need a CNAME record for `www.milantimalsina4.com.np`. This typically points to your specific Netlify site URL (e.g., `milantimalsina.netlify.app`).

* **Type:** `CNAME`
* **Name:** `www`
* **Target:** Your specific Netlify-generated subdomain (e.g., `milantimalsina.netlify.app`). You can find this on your Netlify project's domain management page, usually listed right above your custom domains.
* **Proxy status:** Ensure the cloud icon is **orange (Proxied)**.
* Click **"Save"**.

**Summary of what your Cloudflare DNS records for `milantimalsina4.com.np` should look like:**

| Type  | Name                 | Content                         | Proxy Status |
| :---- | :------------------- | :------------------------------ | :----------- |
| CNAME | `@`                  | `apex-loadbalancer.netlify.com` | Proxied (Orange Cloud) |
| CNAME | `www`                | `milantimalsina.netlify.app`    | Proxied (Orange Cloud) |
| (Any existing records like MX, TXT, NS will remain) | ... | ... | ... |

**Important Final Steps:**

1.  **Delete any existing A records:** If you previously added an `A` record for `@` pointing to `75.2.60.5` (or any other IP), **delete it** now that you are using the recommended CNAME approach.
2.  **Wait for Propagation:** After making these changes in Cloudflare, it can take some time (minutes to a few hours) for the DNS changes to propagate across the internet.
3.  **Check Netlify Status:** Go back to your Netlify dashboard for `milantimalsina4.com.np` (the "Domain management" section). The "Awaiting External DNS" status should eventually update to "DNS Verified" and then "Netlify DNS" or "Active" as Netlify detects the correct records. Netlify will then automatically provision an SSL certificate for your domain.

This process will successfully connect your `milantimalsina4.com.np` domain to your Netlify project while leveraging Cloudflare for your DNS management and its benefits.
